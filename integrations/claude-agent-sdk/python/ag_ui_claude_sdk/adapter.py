        lifecycle is run SERIALIZATION, which must stay decoupled from

        ``await run_lock.acquire()`` in the window after run A released the lock

        identity after acquire (in ``run``) is not sufficient alone, because a
        held/waited lock can still be popped and re-created. So we leave run-lock
        entries resident. Only ``_run_locks`` is exempt from eviction here:
        ``_state_locks`` IS still popped (below), because it is acquired only
        mid-stream UNDER the run-lock, so a live run always holds the run-lock
        while touching it and it can never be orphaned by eviction. This is
        bounded by the number of distinct ``thread_id``
        values seen (each maps to one tiny ``asyncio.Lock``); a future
        ``ThreadContext`` unification (one record per thread owning worker + all
        locks + state, reaped together) is the long-term home for bounding it —
