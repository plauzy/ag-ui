# Runner._resolve_invocation_id() was added somewhere between google-adk 1.24
# and 1.28 and is present on every version since (including 1.30.0, the release
# whose failing tests motivated ag-ui-protocol/ag-ui#1534). It inspects
# new_message and — if it contains a FunctionResponse — forcibly substitutes
# the caller-supplied invocation_id with the one on the matching FunctionCall
# event, then routes the run through the resumed-invocation path. For
# standalone LlmAgent roots that previously emitted end_of_agent=True on the
# function_call event, that path early-returns without calling the LLM, so
# HITL resumption silently produces zero content events.
#
# When this override is present we reshape the tool-result submission so that
# new_message does NOT contain a FunctionResponse: the FunctionResponse is
# pre-appended to the session as its own event, and new_message becomes a
# minimal placeholder that short-circuits _resolve_invocation_id.

    """``asyncio.Queue`` that defers HITL ``ToolCallEndEvent``s.

    Why: writing ``pending_tool_calls`` to ``session.state`` while ADK's
    Runner still owns its in-memory session trips
    ``DatabaseSessionService``'s OCC check on ADK >= 1.27 (issue #1732).
    PR #1735 fixed that by making the consumer ``await execution.task``
    before persisting, but that approach buffers every event after the
    first HITL ``TOOL_CALL_END`` in ``event_queue`` until the producer
    exits — losing streaming fidelity for non-HITL events that arrive
    afterwards (parallel tool calls, post-LRO text, backend tool
    results in resumable HITL).

    This queue defers ONLY the HITL ``ToolCallEndEvent`` itself. All
    other events stream live. The producer flushes the deferred TCEs
    once it has persisted the matching IDs to ``session.state`` — see
    ``_run_adk_in_background``. Putting the completion sentinel
    (``None``) implicitly flushes any remaining deferred TCEs, so the
    consumer sees them before the stream ends.

    The release-on-result branch handles the edge case of a tool that
    is marked HITL but resolves in-stream: when a ``ToolCallResultEvent``
    for a deferred id arrives, the buffered TCE is released
    immediately (preserving TCE→Result ordering on the wire) and
    removed from the deferred set so it is not persisted at flush time.

        Args:
            adk_agent: The ADK agent instance to use
            app_name: Static application name for all requests
            app_name_extractor: Function to extract app name dynamically from input
            user_id: Static user ID for all requests
            user_id_extractor: Function to extract user ID dynamically from input
            session_service: Session management service (defaults to InMemorySessionService).
                When provided, this ADKAgent gets a dedicated SessionManager wrapping
                the service, so multiple ADKAgents with distinct services no longer
                collide (see GitHub issue #1601).
            session_manager: Pre-constructed SessionManager to use. When provided,
                ``session_service`` and the session-cleanup configuration arguments
                are ignored (configure the manager directly instead). Useful when
                multiple ADKAgents should share a manager for consolidated cleanup
                and per-user session limits.
            artifact_service: File/artifact storage service
            memory_service: Conversation memory and search service (also enables automatic session memory)
            credential_service: Authentication credential storage
            run_config_factory: Function to create RunConfig per request
            use_in_memory_services: Use in-memory implementations for unspecified services
            execution_timeout_seconds: Timeout for entire execution
            tool_timeout_seconds: Timeout for individual tool calls
            max_concurrent_executions: Maximum concurrent background executions
            cleanup_interval_seconds: Interval for session cleanup
            max_sessions_per_user: Maximum concurrent sessions per user (None = unlimited)
            delete_session_on_cleanup: Whether to delete sessions from the adk SessionService on session cache cleanup
            save_session_to_memory_on_cleanup: Whether to save sessions to the adk MemoryService on session cache cleanup
            hitl_max_wait_seconds: Maximum time (in seconds) to preserve expired sessions
                that have pending HITL tool calls before force-deleting them. None (default)
                means no limit — sessions with pending tool calls are preserved indefinitely.
                Set this to automatically clean up abandoned HITL sessions.
            predict_state: Configuration for predictive state updates. When provided,
                the agent will emit PredictState CustomEvents for matching tool calls,
                enabling the UI to show state changes in real-time as tool arguments
                are streamed. Use PredictStateMapping to define which tool arguments
                map to which state keys.
            emit_messages_snapshot: Whether to emit a MessagesSnapshotEvent at the end
                of each run containing the full conversation history. Defaults to False
                to preserve existing behavior. Set to True for clients that need the
                full message history (e.g., for client-side persistence or AG-UI
                protocol compliance). Note: Clients using CopilotKit can use the
                /agents/state endpoint instead for on-demand history retrieval.
            streaming_function_call_arguments: Whether to enable streaming of function
                call arguments from Gemini 3+ models via Vertex AI. When enabled,
                TOOL_CALL_ARGS events are emitted incrementally as the model streams
                partial arguments, allowing the UI to show progressive updates.
                Requires google-adk >= 1.24.0 and stream_function_call_arguments=True
                in the model's GenerateContentConfig. Defaults to False.
            use_thread_id_as_session_id: When True, use the AG-UI thread_id directly
                as the ADK session_id instead of letting the backend generate one.
                Eliminates the O(n) list_sessions scan for session recovery after
                middleware restarts. Defaults to False for backward compatibility.
            capabilities: Optional dictionary of agent capabilities conforming to
                the AG-UI AgentCapabilities schema. When provided, the capabilities
                are returned from the GET /capabilities endpoint, enabling frontend
                clients to discover agent features before initiating a run. Use the
                "custom" key for application-specific feature flags (e.g.,
                {"custom": {"predictiveChips": True, "suggestedQuestions": True}}).
            a2ui: A2UI auto-injection config — everything A2UI-related in one place
                (mirrors ``StrandsAgentConfig.a2ui``). When the CopilotKit runtime
                forwards ``injectA2UITool`` (or ``a2ui["inject_a2ui_tool"]`` opts in
                on a host that doesn't), the adapter injects a ``generate_a2ui``
                recovery tool onto the root ``LlmAgent`` and infers the sub-agent
                model from that agent's ``canonical_model`` — no manual
                ``get_a2ui_tool()`` wiring needed. Keys:

                - ``inject_a2ui_tool`` — opt in without the runtime flag; a string
                  also names the injected render tool to drop from the frontend
                  tools.
                - ``default_catalog_id`` — catalog id stamped into auto-injected
                  surfaces (must match the host renderer's catalog).
                - ``guidelines`` — ``{"composition_guide": ...}`` teaches the
                  sub-agent the catalog's components; required for a real model to
                  compose them.
                - ``catalog`` — inline catalog override for catalog-aware recovery
                  (otherwise resolved from the run's schema context / session state).
                - ``recovery`` — recovery loop config (camelCase keys per the shared
                  toolkit contract, e.g. ``{"maxAttempts": 5}``).

            Note:
            If delete_session_on_cleanup=False but save_session_to_memory_on_cleanup=True, sessions will accumulate in SessionService but still be saved to memory on cleanup.
