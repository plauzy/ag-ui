/**
 * Predictive State Updates example for AWS Strands (TypeScript).
 *
 * Mirrors `python/examples/server/api/predictive_state_updates.py`.
 *
 * `write_document` is declared on the frontend (the dojo page registers it via
 * `useHumanInTheLoop`), so the adapter auto-registers it as a proxy tool when
 * `RunAgentInput.tools` arrives. No backend tool here.
 *
 * The demo is the `predictState` mapping below. Before the first argument delta
 * reaches the browser, the adapter emits a `PredictState` custom event saying
 * that the tool's `document` argument feeds the `document` state key. The
 * frontend then paints the document editor from the partial JSON while the model
 * is still streaming it, instead of waiting for the completed tool call.
 *
 * `stateFromArgs` closes the loop with an authoritative `StateSnapshot`
 * carrying the finished document, emitted before `TOOL_CALL_END` so the
 * editor's optimistic text is replaced by server-confirmed state rather than
 * left as a prediction.

To write or edit the document, you MUST use the \`write_document\` tool.
You MUST pass the full updated document, even when changing only a few words.
When making edits, keep them minimal: do not rewrite every word.
Format the document with markdown, but never use italic or strike-through
formatting, which is reserved for showing the user a diff.
Keep stories SHORT.

After calling the tool, do NOT repeat the document as a message. Just briefly
summarize the changes you made, 2 sentences max.`;
