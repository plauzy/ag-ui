/**
 * A2UI Fixed Schema example for AWS Strands (TypeScript, OSS-158).
 *
 * Strands port of the LangGraph / ADK `a2ui_fixed_schema` demo. Unlike the
 * dynamic demo (which relies on the adapter auto-injecting `generate_a2ui` to
 * *generate* a surface), the fixed-schema demo wires two plain backend tools —
 * `search_flights` and `search_hotels`. The component layout is fixed (the
 * `*_SCHEMA` consts below); only the *data* changes per call. Each tool returns
 * the `a2ui_operations` envelope (createSurface -> updateComponents ->
 * updateDataModel), which the runtime's A2UIMiddleware detects in the tool
 * result and paints. No sub-agent, no generation, no recovery loop.
 *
 * The tool returns the envelope as a JSON string (via `wrapAsOperationsEnvelope`)
 * so the Strands adapter lands it in a `text` block the client A2UIMiddleware
 * scans for `a2ui_operations`.
