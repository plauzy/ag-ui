/**
 * Request-scoped model context for the AWS Strands bridge.
 *
 * `RunAgentInput.context` is what the application knew at the moment the user
 * asked: the selected record, the locale, whatever `useCopilotReadable`
 * published. The bridge already hands it to tools and hooks through
 * `buildContextExtras` and to the A2UI subagent through `planA2UIInjection`,
 * but nothing put it in front of the model itself, so context the app
 * injected was invisible to the LLM. This module renders it as one text block
 * and shows that block to the model for exactly one call, never persisting
 * it. It is the counterpart of the Python bridge's `_format_agui_context`,
 * `_MODEL_CONTEXT_BLOCK` and `_TransientModelContextHook`, and every
 * observable choice below (block wording, placement, restore) is kept in step
 * with that side so both bridges send the same prompt for the same input.
 *
 * Two constraints shape the design:
 *
 * 1. The block is request-scoped, and two threads can be in flight in one
 *    process, so nothing module-level and mutable may carry it. Python uses a
 *    `ContextVar`; the direct Node analogue is `AsyncLocalStorage`, which
 *    follows the async continuation chain rather than the module. The store
 *    is set around each pull of the Strands stream, exactly as Python's
 *    `_stream_with_model_context` sets and resets its token around each
 *    `__anext__`, so every continuation the SDK schedules while serving that
 *    pull (the model call, the hooks around it) inherits the run's block and
 *    nothing outside the pull does.
 *
 * 2. The block must reach the model without reaching the durable
 *    conversation: not `agent.messages` after the call, not a
 *    `MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT`, not the session store. So it is spliced into
 *    `agent.messages` from a `BeforeModelCallEvent` hook and spliced back out
 *    from the paired `AfterModelCallEvent` hook, with the run-loop teardown as
 *    a second restore for the cancellation path where the after-hook never
 *    fires. The mutation is recorded per agent in a `WeakMap`, the TS
 *    counterpart of the marker attribute Python sets on the agent instance.

 *   answers that with HTTP 400 "An assistant message with 'tool_calls' must be
 *   followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'".
 * - The one-to-one formatters (anthropic, bedrock, gemini) map each native
 *   message to one provider message, so two consecutive user turns bind as two
 *   consecutive user messages, which those providers reject for failing role
 *   alternation.
 *
