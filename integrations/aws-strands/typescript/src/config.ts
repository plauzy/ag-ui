   * The adapter builds one Strands `Agent` per thread from the template it was

   * Some settings cannot be read back at all: Strands consumes them into
   * internal state during construction and keeps nothing under a name the
   * adapter can find. `retryStrategy`, `traceAttributes` and `contextManager`
   * are the current examples. Others are readable but belong to the agent that
   * owns them, so handing the same instance to every thread would let one
   * conversation disturb another.
   *
   * Either way the template is the wrong place to put them, and no amount of
   * reflection over a built `Agent` recovers them. This hook is the supported
   * route: it runs once per `threadId`, and whatever it returns is applied over
   * the recovered fields, so a caller can set anything the adapter cannot carry
   * and can override anything it can.
   *
   * Three fields are re-asserted by the adapter afterwards, because they are
   * what keeps threads apart and a run coherent: the `SessionManager` from
   * `sessionManagerProvider`, the seeded `messages` for a cold thread, and
   * `printer`, which stays off because the adapter streams the run itself.
   *
   * Called with the same `RunAgentInput` that created the thread. If it throws,
   * the run yields `RUN_ERROR` and the thread is not cached, so the next
   * request retries it.

   * ```ts
   * new StrandsAgent({

   *   name: "assistant",
   *   config: {
   *     // Retries disabled, and a fresh context manager per conversation.

   * `forwardedProps` or `context`, and a tool the request must not reach is
   * simply left out of the returned iterable. May be async.
   *
   * Return the tools themselves or their names, whichever is to hand. Return
   * `null` or `undefined` to decline filtering, which leaves every template
   * tool available; an empty array is a real answer and leaves none of them. A
   * name the template does not contribute is dropped with a warning, because
   * this hook narrows the wrapped agent's tools and cannot add one.
   *
   * The container is checked rather than merely iterated. A `string` and a
   * `Map` are both refused, as is a plain object: a bare name would come apart
   * into characters, and a permission map would have its keys read as an
   * allow-list while its values went unread, so a name mapped to `false` would
   * still be allowed. Arrays, sets and generators are all accepted.
   *
   * Applied to the live per-thread agent's tool registry, never by rebuilding
   * that agent: the instance holds the thread's `SessionManager`, its native
   * interrupt checkpoint and its history, so replacing it to change a tool list
   * would discard a conversation and any approval waiting inside it.
   *
   * Three consequences worth knowing:
   *
   * - A tool in the batch a live interrupt checkpoint would resume stays
   *   registered whatever this returns. The human's answer is about to be
   *   routed back into that batch, and an absent tool turns it into a "tool not
   *   found" the model re-fires. This is the rule `syncProxyTools` already
   *   applies to a proxy parked in a frontend-tool interrupt. The exemption
   *   does not outlast what it is for: the narrowing is re-applied inside the
   *   run once the batch has been dispatched, before the model is asked again.
   * - History is never rewritten. A filtered-out tool's earlier calls and
   *   results stay in the thread's messages, so the model can still read what
   *   it did with a tool it can no longer call, and a provider that returns
   *   different sets across turns does not invalidate the transcript.
   * - If it throws, the run yields `RUN_ERROR` with code
   *   `TEMPLATE_TOOLS_PROVIDER_ERROR` and stops, matching `threadAgentConfig`.
   *   A filter that fails open would hand the model tools the caller meant to
   *   withhold.
   *
   * Client-declared tools on `RunAgentInput.tools` are outside this hook: they
   * are re-synchronised from the request every turn already, so a caller that
   * wants fewer of those sends fewer. Not applied on the multi-agent
   * orchestrator path, which has no template registry to filter.
   *
   * One deployment note. With an `agentsByThread` map a request-scoped wrapper
   * is rebuilt per request while the cached thread agent keeps the registry it
   * already had, so a template whose tools are built per request hands the
   * adapter equivalent but not identical objects. Ownership of a registry
   * entry therefore falls back from object identity to the tool's name plus
   * "not one of the adapter's other producers". Stable tool objects are still
   * the simpler thing to hand it.
   *
   * @example
   * ```ts
   * new StrandsAgent({
   *   agent: template,
   *   name: "assistant",
   *   config: {
   *     templateToolsProvider: (input) =>
   *       input.forwardedProps?.role === "admin" ? null : ["read_docs"],

   * with the server's own network reach rather than the client's. Anyone who
   * can post a `RunAgentInput` can name the URL.
   *
   * `undefined` uses `DEFAULT_URL_FETCH_POLICY`, which fetches only `http`
   * and `https`, refuses any host that resolves outside the public internet
   * (loopback, private, link-local, multicast, reserved, unspecified,
   * including the cloud metadata endpoints), pins the connection to the
   * address it validated so a second DNS answer cannot move it, re-checks
   * every redirect hop under this same policy, refuses a redirect that drops
   * TLS, and caps one attachment's size and the time it may take.
   *
   * Private-network access is opt-in and is the host's decision, never the
   * client's. A deployment whose attachments live on a private CDN or behind

   * Link-local addresses and the cloud metadata endpoints stay blocked even
   * under that opt-in. `allowedSchemes` can only be narrowed, never widened:
   * an http/https request is issued through a transport pinned to the
   * addresses that passed validation, and any other scheme would go through a
   * client that resolves the host again at connection time, reopening the
   * rebinding window this policy exists to close. Narrow it with
   * `allowedSchemes: new Set(["https"])`.
   *
   * An unusable policy (a limit below one, a fractional redirect cap, a
   * scheme outside http/https, a non-boolean `allowPrivateNetworks`) fails
   * the run with `RUN_ERROR { code: "URL_FETCH_POLICY_INVALID" }` before any
   * attachment is fetched. It never silently reverts to the default.
   *
   * Python's `url_fetch_policy` is the same option, and the two policies do
