/**
 * Durable recovery of frontend tool results across a process restart.
 *
 * A frontend tool executes on the client, so server-side the proxy persists a
 * `"Forwarded to client"` placeholder `toolResult` and the run halts. The real
 * answer arrives on the NEXT request, which a restarted process (or a different
 * instance behind a load balancer) has no in-memory memory of. Recovery
 * therefore has to come entirely out of the session store: the placeholder to
 * correct, and the record of which call ids this adapter handed to the client.
 *
 * These tests drive a REAL Strands `Agent`, a REAL `SessionManager` over a real
 * on-disk `FileStorage`, and a scripted model (no provider calls). The restart
 * is a genuine one: turn 2 runs on a brand-new adapter, a brand-new agent and a
 * brand-new session manager that share nothing but the storage directory.
