/**
 * The continuation decision, enumerated.
 *
 * What a continuation turn should do is one decision over one input space, and
 * this file is that space written down. Every row fixes a point in it and
 * asserts the WHOLE outcome: whether the run failed and under which code, which
 * path ran, what the model actually received, and what the session store holds
 * afterwards. A change that moves one input therefore has to state what it did
 * to every row it touches.
 *
 * The dimensions:
 *
 *   admitted          the call id was still recorded when the result came back
 *   void              the client answered with nothing
 *   failed            the client reported a failure
 *   duplicateId       one payload repeats a call id
 *   unnameable        a trailing result nothing can name
 *   unnamedInRequest  only the store names the call the result answers
 *   resume            the turn carries `resume[]`
 *   replay            history replay into Strands, i.e. no session manager
 *   unwritableSession a session manager reached as a plugin, no `saveSnapshot`
 *   competingHalt     a `stopStreamingAfterResult` tool shares the batch
 *   streamerFails     the tool's `argsStreamer` throws, so args go out at once
 *   parked            an activated checkpoint parks the proxy placeholder
 *   withholdResume    the parked turn resumes with no answer for the call
 *   plainFollowUp     turn 2 is an ordinary user turn, not a resume
 *   malformed         the tool message's `content` is not a plain string
 *   deltaOnly         the payload sends the results alone, declaring no tools
 *   newerUser         a user message follows the result, so the turn has a prompt
 *   beforeUserTurn    the result arrives before a user turn, not after it
 *   trimmed           the history window slid past the turn holding the result
 *   declined          the correction was refused, so no repair landed
 *
 * The model is the only stub, so no provider is called. Every row drives a REAL
 * Strands `Agent`; what sits behind it is the `replay` and `unwritableSession`
 * dimensions' business, so a real `SessionManager` over a real on-disk
 * `FileStorage` is what MOST rows get rather than all of them: a `replay` row
 * wires no session manager and an `unwritableSession` row wires one with no
 * storage, and neither leaves anything on disk to read back. The rows that do
 * have a store also get a genuine restart, the continuation running on a
 * brand-new adapter, agent and session manager that share nothing but the
 * storage directory. A `parked` row is the exception: the checkpoint it resumes
 * is live in the first process, so it stays there.
