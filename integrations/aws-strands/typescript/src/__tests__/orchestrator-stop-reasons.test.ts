/**
 * Abnormal stop reasons on the orchestrator path (Graph/Swarm).
 *
 * The orchestrator counterpart of `stop-reasons.test.ts`, for the ONE thing the
 * two paths genuinely share: the `AgentStopped` hint. A node that stops
 * abnormally must announce it the same way a lone `Agent` does, so a client
 * matches one payload rather than one per wiring.
 *
 * The hint arrives differently here. A `Graph` never puts a stop reason on its
 * own terminal `MultiAgentResult`; the per-node stop reason rides an
 * `agentResultEvent` nested inside `nodeStreamUpdateEvent.inner`, because
 * `AgentNode.handle` forwards every event the wrapped `Agent.stream()` yields.
 * Every assertion here pins the wire payload rather than the branch that
 * produced it.
 *
 * Terminal FAILURE is deliberately not shared. `Node.stream`
 * (`multiagent/nodes.js`) turns any throw out of a node into a FAILED
 * `NodeResult` and returns normally, so a provider failure inside a Graph node
 * never reaches the adapter at all; the only exceptions that escape a real
 * `Graph` or `Swarm` are orchestration budget violations, which the outer
 * handler reports as `STRANDS_ERROR`. The scripted stub below therefore throws
 * only budget-shaped failures. `orchestrator-real-graph.test.ts` drives both
 * facts against real SDK objects rather than a stub.
