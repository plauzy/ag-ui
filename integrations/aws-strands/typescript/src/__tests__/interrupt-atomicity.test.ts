/**
 * A rejected resume must be atomic and must leave the checkpoint retryable.
 *
 * Atomic: the gate rejects before anything is mutated, so the model is never
 * invoked and the run's client tools are never registered on the per-thread
 * agent. Retryable: the interrupts stay open, so a later complete and valid
 * batch still resumes the run rather than the rejection burning the checkpoint.
 *
 * Driven through the real Strands SDK: the interrupts are raised by the real
 * interrupt machinery, so what is under test is the adapter's real gate over
 * real checkpoint state.
