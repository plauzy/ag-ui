/**
 * Template-field forwarding, asserted against a genuine `Agent`.
 *
 * The sibling suite drives a hand-built template object whose fields all sit
 * on public properties. A real `Agent` does not store them that way: several
 * are only reachable under an underscore-prefixed name. Forwarding logic that
 * reads the public names returns `undefined` for a field the caller did set,
 * and a suite built on a fabricated template cannot tell the difference.
 *
 * These tests exist so that it can. Anything a real Agent exposes under no
 * name at all is pinned in the fabricated suite instead, where the assertion
 * can actually fail.
