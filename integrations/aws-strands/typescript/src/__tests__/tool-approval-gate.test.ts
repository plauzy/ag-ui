/**
 * `toolBehaviors[name].interruptOnCall` approval semantics, driven through the
 * real Strands SDK: a real `Agent` built by the adapter, the adapter's own
 * `BeforeToolCallEvent` hook, and the SDK's real interrupt/resume machinery.
 *
 * Approval is granted only by a strict boolean `true`. Truthy strings and
 * numbers must not coerce into approval, so a `!response.approved` regression
 * in the gate is caught here rather than shipping.
 *
 * Two blocks reach past the public surface: the hook-level one dispatches
 * through the agent's private hook registry, which is the only way to vary the
 * resume response a single run can produce, and the client-tool case reads the
 * adapter's private pending-interrupt map.
 *
 * Two independent layers reject a bad resume payload, and each is pinned
 * separately below:
 *   1. the run-level `responseSchema` check, which rejects a non-boolean
 *      `approved` before Strands is resumed at all;
 *   2. the approval hook itself, which is what actually decides whether the
 *      tool runs once Strands hands the response back.
