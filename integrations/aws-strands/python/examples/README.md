# AWS Strands Example Server

Demo FastAPI server that wires the Strands Agents SDK into the AG-UI protocol
with support for multiple model providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini). Each of
the fifteen routes mounts a ready-made agent showing one thing the adapter does:
plain chat, reasoning, citations, multimodal input, backend and frontend tools,
shared state, generative UI, predictive state updates, human-in-the-loop, native
interrupts, a multi-agent graph, and the three A2UI surfaces. The table below is
the list that matters; this sentence is a summary of it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 – 3.14 (the project is pinned to `<3.15`)
- Poetry 1.8+ (install with `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`)
- An API key for your chosen model provider (see Environment Variables below)
- (Optional) AG-UI repo running locally so you can point the Dojo at these routes

## Quick start

```bash
cd integrations/aws-strands/python/examples

poetry install
```

Create a `.env` file in this folder (same dir as `pyproject.toml`) so every
example can load credentials automatically:

```bash
# Choose your provider: openai (default), anthropic, or gemini
MODEL_PROVIDER=openai

# Provider API keys (only the one for your chosen provider is required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key

# Optional overrides
PORT=8000                 # FastAPI listen port

# Override the default model for your provider. Leave it commented out rather
# than blank with a trailing comment: python-dotenv reads `KEY=  # note` as the
# literal comment text, not as an empty value.
# MODEL_ID=

# Comma-separated browser origins to allow. Unset or blank allows every origin;
# a value that was written but names none refuses them all rather than widening.
# CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://app.example,https://admin.example
```

> Default models per provider: `gpt-5.4` (OpenAI), `claude-sonnet-4-6`
> (Anthropic), `gemini-2.5-flash` (Gemini). Set `MODEL_ID` to override.

## Running the demo server

Either command exposes all mounted apps on `http://localhost:${PORT:-8000}`:

```bash
poetry run dev          # uses the Poetry script entry point (server:main)
# or
poetry run python -m server
```

The root route lists the available demos:

| Route                       | Description                                                     |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/a2ui-dynamic-schema`      | A2UI surfaces composed on the fly                               |
| `/a2ui-fixed-schema`        | A2UI from fixed-layout backend tools                            |
| `/a2ui-recovery`            | A2UI validate-and-retry recovery loop                           |
| `/agentic-chat`             | Simple chat agent with a frontend-only `change_background` tool |
| `/agentic-chat-reasoning`   | Reasoning / thinking event streaming                            |
| `/agentic-chat-citations`   | Answers carrying the sources they came from                     |
| `/agentic-chat-multimodal`  | Multimodal image / document analysis                            |
| `/backend-tool-rendering`   | Backend-executed tools (charts, faux weather) rendered in AG-UI |
| `/agentic-generative-ui`    | Demonstrates `PredictState` + state snapshots for plan tracking |
| `/shared-state`             | Recipe builder showing shared JSON state + tool arguments       |
| `/human-in-the-loop`        | Frontend tool parked in a native Strands wait                   |
| `/interrupt`                | Tool pauses to ask the user for a meeting time                  |
| `/predictive-state-updates` | Document editor driven by streaming tool args                   |
| `/tool-based-generative-ui` | Frontend-rendered tool (`generate_haiku`)                       |
| `/multi-agent`              | Strands graph of agents, streamed as steps                      |

Point the AG-UI Dojo (or any AG-UI client) at these SSE endpoints to see the
Strands wrapper translate provider events into protocol-native messages.

### Demos that pin their own model

`MODEL_PROVIDER` still selects the provider for every demo. Two of them ask
`model_factory.py` for OpenAI's Responses API on top of that, because the feature
they show is reachable there with the key the dojo already has. The request is
honoured only when the selected provider is `openai`; on the others it is ignored
rather than overriding anything:

- `agentic_chat_citations.py` asks for the Responses API plus the built-in
  `web_search` tool, the one built-in whose annotations Strands maps to
  citations. `create_model` still dispatches on `MODEL_PROVIDER`, so on
  `anthropic` or `gemini` the request is ignored and the run succeeds while
  citing nothing.
- `agentic_chat_reasoning.py` asks for the Responses API with reasoning
  summaries. On `anthropic` the factory requests extended thinking instead and
  `REASONING_*` events still arrive; on `gemini` they do not.

The citations demo also needs `strands-agents>=1.35.0`. This server's
`pyproject.toml` asks for `^1.35.0` and there is no lockfile beside it, so the
version you get is resolved fresh at install time. Earlier releases ship the
Responses model without the URL-citation mapping, and the run then succeeds and
cites nothing there too.

| `CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` | No                 | Comma-separated browser origins to allow, applied to the dojo app and to every mounted demo. Matched against the `Origin` header exactly; a trailing slash and letter case are repaired, nothing else is validated. Unset or blank allows every origin, the local-development default. A value that was written but names no usable origin refuses every cross-origin request rather than widening. Both cases are reported once at startup |

OpenTelemetry exporters are off, so `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED` and
`OTEL_PYTHON_DISABLED_INSTRUMENTATIONS` need no setting. That is stronger than a
default, though. `server/__init__.py` uses `setdefault`, which an operator value
would survive, but most `server/api/*.py` modules then assign both variables
outright and overwrite whatever you set, so turning telemetry back on means
editing those modules rather than the environment.

## How it works

- Each `server/api/*.py` file constructs a Strands `Agent`, or a `Graph` of them
  in the multi-agent demo, registers any tools, and wraps it with
  `ag_ui_strands.StrandsAgent`.
- `server/__init__.py` mounts every demo app listed in `server/settings.py`
  as its own sub-application and exposes the `main()` entrypoint that
  `poetry run dev` calls.
- `server/settings.py` holds the demo route table (`DEMO_PATHS`), the `PORT`
  contract, and the CORS allowlist that the dojo app and each mounted demo are
  both given. Adding a demo means adding its module under `server/api/` and its
  path here; `server/__init__.py` derives the mount name and the `server.api`
  attribute from the path rather than keeping a second list.
- The project depends on `ag_ui_strands` via a path dependency (`..`) so you can
  develop the integration and server side-by-side without publishing a wheel.
- `server/model_factory.py` centralises model construction. Set `MODEL_PROVIDER`
  and optionally `MODEL_ID` to switch between OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini
  without editing any example file.
