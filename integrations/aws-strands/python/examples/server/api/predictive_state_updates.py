"""Predictive State Updates example for AWS Strands.

``write_document`` is declared on the frontend (the dojo page registers it via
``useHumanInTheLoop``), so the adapter auto-registers it as a proxy tool when
``RunAgentInput.tools`` arrives. No backend ``@tool`` here.

The demo is the ``predict_state`` mapping below. Before the first argument delta
reaches the browser, the adapter emits a ``PredictState`` custom event saying
that the tool's ``document`` argument feeds the ``document`` state key. The
frontend then paints the document editor from the partial JSON while the model
is still streaming it, instead of waiting for the completed tool call.

``state_from_args`` closes the loop with an authoritative ``StateSnapshot``
carrying the finished document, emitted before ``TOOL_CALL_END`` so the
editor's optimistic text is replaced by server-confirmed state rather than
left as a prediction.
