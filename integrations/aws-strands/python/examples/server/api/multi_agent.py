"""Multi-agent example for AWS Strands.

A Strands ``Graph`` of three specialist agents wired in sequence. The adapter
drives the orchestrator directly and translates its node lifecycle into AG-UI
STEP_STARTED / STEP_FINISHED plus ``MultiAgentHandoff`` CUSTOM events, so the
dojo page can show which node is running and how control moved between them.

Node ids are the strings the UI and the end-to-end specs match on, so they must
stay in sync with the dojo page.
