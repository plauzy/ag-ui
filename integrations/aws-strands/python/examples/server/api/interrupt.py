"""Interrupt example for AWS Strands.

``schedule_meeting`` pauses itself. Strands' native interrupt system lets a tool
call ``tool_context.interrupt(...)``, which halts the agent loop and finishes the
run with ``RUN_FINISHED`` carrying ``outcome.type == "interrupt"``. The dojo's
interrupt page renders its time picker, and resuming on the same ``thread_id``
returns the user's choice from that same ``interrupt()`` call so the tool body
continues where it left off.

The resume payload arrives wrapped: a resolved answer as ``{"response": ...}``,
a client-side cancel as ``{"cancelled": True}``. The adapter wraps it because
Strands' resume gate is truthiness-based and a bare falsy answer would re-raise
the same interrupt forever.

Pause and resume happen on the same live wrapper and process here, so no
``SessionManager`` is needed. Durable, cross-process resume requires one.
