"""Per-request filtering of the tools the template agent contributed.

The adapter builds one Strands ``Agent`` per thread and keeps it. That instance
is load-bearing: it holds the thread's ``SessionManager``, its native interrupt
checkpoint and its conversation history. Changing which tools a request sees
therefore has to be done to the registry the live instance already owns, the
way client-declared tools are already synchronised, and never by constructing a
replacement.

Scope is the template's own tools. Client-declared tools arrive on
``RunAgentInput.tools`` every request and are synchronised by
:func:`~ag_ui_strands.client_proxy_tool.sync_proxy_tools`; a caller that wants
fewer of those sends fewer. Auto-injected A2UI tools are the adapter's and are
refreshed per turn. What no per-request channel reached until now is the set the
wrapped template contributed once, at construction.
