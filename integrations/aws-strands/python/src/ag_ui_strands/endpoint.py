    The guard matters even though the `EventEncoder` shipped with

    which makes the choice invisible today. The TypeScript `EventEncoder`
    does negotiate, offering protobuf as the only candidate and asking

    header there would hand binary frames to every client that accepts
    anything, so its endpoint carries this same wildcard guard. Python
    keeps it so it does not acquire that behaviour the moment its own
    encoder gains protobuf.

    An unquoted `q=0` resolves to SSE on both adapters, at different
    layers: here in the guard, and there inside the encoder. A quoted
