    The event NAME and the payload KEYS mirror the TypeScript bridge exactly so
    a client handles one shape across both languages. Three things about the
    surrounding behaviour are deliberately not identical:

    - ``hook`` carries each language's own spelling of the callback the
      developer configured, so this reports ``state_from_args`` where
      TypeScript reports ``stateFromArgs``. Emitting TypeScript's spelling here
      would name a callback that does not exist in a Python config.
    - ``tool_stream_event_handler`` is reported here and only logged in
      TypeScript, so Python emits from nine sites and TypeScript from eight.
      It is also the one hook dispatched per streamed chunk, so its report is
      deduplicated to once per tool call.
    - After ``args_streamer`` throws, Python emits the full arguments as a
      fallback delta and completes the tool call; TypeScript emits no fallback
      and returns. That one predates this event and is left alone, because
      changing it would change what a throwing hook does to the run.

    ``tool`` is the tool whose ``ToolBehavior`` declared the hook, and
    ``CUSTOM_HOOK_ERROR_PROMPT_TOOL`` for ``state_context_builder``, which runs
    outside any tool call. Tool names are passed through unvalidated, so a tool
    named ``__prompt__`` would be indistinguishable from the builder. Reserving
    the name is not worth a validation failure inside a hint event.

    ``session_manager_provider`` is not reported here. Its failure is caught
    too, but it is not swallowed: the run ends with a ``RunErrorEvent``, so
    there is nothing left for a hint event to add.

    The message is written to the run's event stream verbatim, so a hook whose
    exceptions embed connection strings or paths puts them in front of whoever
    is reading that stream. TypeScript has always behaved this way and neither
    side gates it.

    A hook failure does not end the run. What the hook itself was for is lost,
    which is the pre-existing behaviour this event makes visible rather than
    changes: a failed ``state_from_*`` leaves the state un-updated, and a failed
    ``args_streamer`` falls back to one full-arguments delta. The traceback
    lives in the log, at eight of the nine sites: ``args_streamer`` logs without
    ``exc_info``, so a failure there leaves none anywhere.

      messages: the turn's non-tool content becomes a message of its own, emitted
      AHEAD of the tool messages the same turn's tool results become, whatever the
      order of the blocks inside the turn. So a turn carrying both text and a tool
      result binds as ``assistant(tool_calls) -> user(text) -> tool(result)``, and
      OpenAI answers that with HTTP 400 "An assistant message with 'tool_calls'
      must be followed by tool messages responding to each 'tool_call_id'".
    - The one-to-one formatters (``anthropic``, ``bedrock``, ``gemini``) map each
      native message to one provider message, so two consecutive user turns bind
      as two consecutive user messages, which those providers reject for failing
      role alternation.

    ``adjacency`` is therefore about the first family and ``alternation`` about
    the second, and a history has to satisfy both because the bridge does not know

    turn breaks adjacency for the splitting formatters; giving it a user turn of
    its own after that turn breaks alternation for the one-to-one formatters.
    Both remaining directions add a turn next to an existing user turn, which
    breaks alternation again. So the text merges into the latest user turn that
    carries no tool result: the question. That leaves the message count, and

    It merges into that turn's existing text block rather than sitting beside it
    as a second one, because the writer formatter refuses a turn carrying more
    than one text block outright, and every other formatter reads one joined
    block the way it would have read two.

    ``placement`` says which side of the existing text the new text goes.
    Application context is a preamble to the question and prepends; a
    synthesized note about what the tools returned is a postscript and appends.

    When the history holds no question at all (a delta payload that replayed only

    its own: appended when there is no user turn to sit beside, and otherwise
