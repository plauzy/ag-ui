"""Reconcile frontend (proxy) tool results into a Strands ``SessionManager``.

Frontend tools are executed on the client, so server-side the proxy returns a
placeholder ``toolResult`` (``"Forwarded to client"``). The real result only
arrives on the next run inside ``RunAgentInput.messages``, keyed by the client's
wire ``tool_call_id`` — which differs from the native ``toolUseId`` Strands
persisted. The adapter records that wire->native mapping durably on the agent's
session state (see ``AG_UI_WIRE_MAP_STATE_KEY``), so this module can find the
persisted placeholder by native id and overwrite it with the real result.
