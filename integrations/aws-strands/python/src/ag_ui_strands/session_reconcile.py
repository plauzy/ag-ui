"""Reconcile frontend (proxy) tool results into a Strands ``SessionManager``.

Frontend tools are executed on the client, so server-side the proxy returns a
placeholder ``toolResult`` (``"Forwarded to client"``). The real result only
arrives on the next run inside ``RunAgentInput.messages``, under the same
``toolUseId`` Strands persisted, so this module can find the persisted
placeholder and overwrite it with the real result.

Nothing on that continuation says who executed the call. The adapter therefore
records the id of every frontend call it emits durably on the agent's session
state (see ``AG_UI_FRONTEND_CALL_IDS_STATE_KEY``): membership there is what
tells a client-executed result apart from one Strands produced itself. The ids
are held in recorded order rather than as a bare set, because the size cap
applied at emission evicts the oldest first.

# than translated. Only a frontend call left in flight across the upgrade is
# affected, and what happens to it depends on the checkpoint: an ordinary
# continuation degrades to the legacy path, which forwards the client's answer
# as a synthetic message, while one parked in an active checkpoint cannot be
# resumed at all, because connecting the answer to the persisted placeholder
