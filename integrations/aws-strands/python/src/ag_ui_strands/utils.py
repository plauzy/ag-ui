    :class:`FutureWarning` and will be removed in a future release.

    Args:
        agent: The StrandsAgent instance
        path: Path for the agent endpoint (default: "/")
        ping_path: Path for the ping endpoint (default: "/ping"). Pass None to disable.

            and silences the implicit-wildcard warning. ``None`` and ``[]``
            preserve the legacy ``["*"]`` fallback. Pass the exact origins your
            frontend is served from, e.g. ``["http://localhost:3000"]``, or pass

            restricts origins. The mounted middleware answers first, so a
            wildcard here replies ``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`` to an
            origin the parent would have refused, and the parent then adds its
            own ``Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`` header on the way out.
        auth: Optional FastAPI dependency callable used to authenticate requests
            to the agent endpoint. It should raise
            :class:`fastapi.HTTPException` to reject a request, e.g.::

                def require_token(authorization: str | None = Header(default=None)):

                app = create_strands_app(agent, auth=require_token)

            The ping endpoint stays unauthenticated so health probes keep working.
        allow_methods: CORS methods to allow. ``None`` defaults to ``["*"]``
            for backward compatibility; ``[]`` allows none.
        allow_headers: CORS request headers to allow. ``None`` defaults to
            ``["*"]`` for backward compatibility; ``[]`` allows none beyond
            CORS-safelisted request headers.
        cors_enabled: Explicit CORS switch. Pass ``False`` to add no CORS
            middleware, even if *origins* is supplied. Pass ``True`` to retain
            CORS explicitly; when *origins* is empty, this uses ``["*"]`` without
            emitting the implicit-wildcard warning. ``None`` preserves the
            legacy behavior and warns when *origins* is empty.
        invocation_state_provider: Optional sync or async callable receiving the
            FastAPI request and validated AG-UI input. Its returned dictionary is
            forwarded as trusted, request-scoped Strands invocation state.
