"""Tests that every Strands Agent __init__ param round-trips to per-thread instances.

Driven by inspect.signature so new Strands params are covered automatically.

Two rules keep this suite honest, both learned the hard way:

* It never skips. A param this suite cannot exercise is a param that would be
  dropped in production without anyone noticing, so an unexercisable param
  fails here instead. The previous version skipped whenever the template
  rejected its sentinel, and that skip is what hid a silently-dropped param
  through several Strands releases.
* It never narrows to a fixed list of params. Discovery off the constructor
  signature is the only reason the gap was ever found; a curated list would
  only ever cover the params someone already knew about.

# ``plugins`` is the param that motivated splitting the two warnings. Strands
# consumes the list during construction: it runs each plugin's ``init_agent``
# against the agent that received it and registers the plugin's hooks and
# tools into that agent's registries, keeping only a registry bound back to
# it. Nothing can be read off the template and nothing can be handed to a
# second agent, so a plugin set on the template never runs against the agents
# that serve requests. The adapter answers that with a dedicated kwarg, and
# tells anyone who used the template instead.
#
# Most of what follows is the adapter reading, reporting and forwarding, none
# of which needs a real plugin. Those tests use a synthetic registry and plain
# sentinels, the way the resolver tests above already do, so they run on every
# supported release rather than only the ones new enough to have plugins.
