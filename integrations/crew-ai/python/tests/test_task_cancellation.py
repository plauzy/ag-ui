"""
Tests for the orphaned kickoff task and missing timeout in the CrewAI
FastAPI endpoint.

The event-generator in ``add_crewai_flow_fastapi_endpoint`` used to spawn the
flow via ``asyncio.create_task(flow.kickoff_async(...))`` *without* holding a
reference and *without* cancelling the task in the generator's ``finally``
block. If the HTTP client disconnected mid-stream, the kickoff coroutine would
continue running forever (leaking memory, file descriptors, and LLM
subscriptions). These tests pin down the desired behaviour across BOTH
endpoint factories (flow and crew):

* The generator keeps a handle to the kickoff task.
* When the generator is closed (as happens when Starlette detects a client
  disconnect), the kickoff task is cancelled and awaited.
* A hard wall-clock ceiling (``AGUI_CREWAI_FLOW_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``) is applied so
  a runaway flow cannot hang the process indefinitely.
* On timeout the stream surfaces a well-formed ``RunErrorEvent`` whose
  ``message`` carries thread/run correlation and the ceiling diagnostic, AND
  whose event-level ``thread_id`` / ``run_id`` extras expose the same IDs
  without requiring consumers to string-parse.
* If ``kickoff_async`` itself raises (auth failure, crewai internal bug), the
  stream surfaces a ``RUN_ERROR`` event carrying the real cause promptly,
  rather than blocking on the queue until the flow-timeout ceiling fires.

    Scope note: ``ChatWithCrewFlow.__init__`` is
    synchronous. The constructor IS slow (it issues a real LLM call), but
    from the event loop's perspective it runs to completion on a single
    tick — it cannot interleave with another coroutine via ``await``.
    The serializing ``asyncio.Lock`` guarantees that even if two
    coroutines race into ``_get_flow()``, only one crosses the
    ``_cached_flow is None`` gate before releasing the lock. A TRUE
    async-init race (where one coroutine awaits inside its __init__
    while another races past) would require a module-level hook that
    inserts an ``await`` between the counter increment and the lock
    release; we don't have that surface here and reproducing it would
    require patching both ``asyncio.Lock`` and adding an async
    constructor shim.

    This test is therefore a POSITIVE-CONTRACT PIN only: it asserts that
    the "check then construct then cache" sequence under the lock
    produces exactly one constructor call even when two coroutines enter
    ``_get_flow()`` concurrently. A regression that removes the lock
    entirely would still be caught because the two coroutines can
    interleave their reads of ``_cached_flow`` if ``_get_flow`` awaits
    any schedulable work between the check and the cache write.

    Strengthening this by monkeypatching ``__init__`` to include
    ``await asyncio.sleep(0)`` was considered. That is
    syntactically impossible — Python's sync ``__init__`` cannot host
    an ``await`` — and the ``_get_flow`` double-check inside the
    ``async with`` critical section means a no-op lock substitute still
    produces a single ctor call (the second caller, after any yield,
    observes ``_cached_flow is not None`` and returns the cache). The
    only regression shape this pin does NOT catch is one where both
    the lock AND the double-check are removed; that pattern is
    structurally distant from the current implementation and would be
    obvious on review. Kept as a positive pin rather than deleted
    (option b) because the exact-one-ctor-call property is itself a
    load-bearing contract worth keeping green through refactors.
