"""Neutralize each containment guard and require the suite to notice.

"Every containment guard has a test that fails when the guard is neutralized" was
a claim confirmed by hand, once, which is the same shape of problem as a README
claim with no executable check. This makes it a check.

Opt-in: it reruns the whole suite once per mutation, so it is deselected by
default and CI time is unchanged.

    uv run python -m pytest tests/test_conversational_guard_mutations.py -m mutation

Line-anchored, and the anchor is the WHOLE line: each entry names the line it
expects and that line's exact text, indentation included. A mismatch, or an
anchor that is no longer unique in its file, is a HARD ERROR rather than a skip.
That is deliberate and load bearing: the first hand-run of this reported "12
killed, no survivors" precisely because absent anchors passed silently. Requiring
the whole line is what makes uniqueness reachable at all, since the guards that
repeat verbatim (three ``self._release_lease()`` calls, two ``if
self._abandoned:``) are told apart by nothing else. An anchor that drifted has to
be re-pointed by a human who checks the guard is still there.

A SURVIVOR means the guard it names is not tested by anything.
