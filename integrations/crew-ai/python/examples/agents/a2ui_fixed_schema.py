"""A2UI fixed-schema flow.

Unlike the dynamic demo (which auto-injects generate_a2ui to GENERATE a
surface), the fixed-schema demo wires two backend tools, ``search_flights`` and
``search_hotels``. The component layout is pre-authored JSON loaded at import;
only the data changes per call. Each tool returns the ``a2ui_operations``
envelope (createSurface -> updateComponents -> updateDataModel) as a tool
result, which the frontend A2UIMiddleware detects and paints. No sub-agent, no
generation, no recovery.
