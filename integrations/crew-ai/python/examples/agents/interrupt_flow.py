"""An example demonstrating async human-in-the-loop via a flow interrupt.

A scheduling assistant, mirroring the interrupt demo the other integrations
ship: the model works out which meeting the user wants, the flow PAUSES so the
user can pick a time, and on resume the model confirms the booking. The human
decision lands in the middle of the agent's own work, which is the point of
human-in-the-loop.

The pause is a real flow suspend: ``@human_feedback`` with the bridge's
``agui_feedback_provider`` raises ``HumanFeedbackPending``, so the run ends with
an AG-UI interrupt and the next request carrying ``RunAgentInput.resume[]``
continues it via ``Flow.from_pending`` + ``resume_async``.

Contrast with ``human_in_the_loop.py``: that demo round-trips a FRONTEND tool
and never pauses the flow. This one suspends the flow itself.
