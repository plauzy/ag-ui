"""
An agentic chat flow that surfaces the model's reasoning.

The reasoning cell lets the user pick a provider from the frontend; the choice
arrives on ``state.model``. Each provider is streamed over the channel that
actually carries its reasoning, and the bridge maps both onto REASONING_*:

* Anthropic (extended thinking) and Gemini reason on the litellm
  chat-completions delta, so they stream through ``acompletion``.
* OpenAI's reasoning models emit reasoning summaries ONLY over the Responses
  API, so they stream through ``copilotkit_responses``. Over chat-completions
  they answer with no thinking trace at all.

The Responses channel is used only when the bridge probes it as available
(``responses_channel_available``); otherwise the flow degrades to
chat-completions with a warning, and OpenAI answers without a trace.
