    Used in the ``finally`` block of the event generators so that a client
    disconnect (which closes the generator) tears down the kickoff coroutine
    instead of leaking it.

    Semantics:
    - A SINGLE shared monotonic deadline (``_cancel_join_timeout_seconds``)
      bounds the combined wait of (grace window + force-cancel join +
      outer-cancel recovery). There is one ceiling window for the entire
      teardown, not three.
    - If ``allow_grace`` and the task is mid-flight on a happy path, wait up
      to ``min(_CANCEL_GRACE_SECONDS, remaining-budget)`` for it to finish
      on its own (the FlowFinishedEvent listener enqueues ``None``
      microseconds before ``kickoff_async`` actually returns). A quick
      ``sleep(0)`` + ``task.done()`` probe fast-paths the common case where
      the task is microseconds from returning, so happy-path requests do
      NOT systematically pay the 1s grace latency tax.
    - The grace wait is SHIELDED and protected by the same outer-cancel
      recovery pattern used post-grace. If the caller is cancelled during
      the grace wait, ``task.cancel()`` still fires via the ``finally`` and
      the task is cleanly unwound within the remaining budget; we don't
      leave a cancelled-but-unjoined task behind.
    - We deliberately do NOT catch ``BaseException``. ``SystemExit`` /
      ``KeyboardInterrupt`` / ``CancelledError`` must propagate; we only
      swallow ``TimeoutError`` (explicitly) and recoverable ``Exception``
      subclasses from the task itself.
    - On Python 3.11+, catching ``CancelledError`` does NOT decrement
      ``Task.cancelling()``: any subsequent ``await`` re-raises immediately
      unless we call ``asyncio.current_task().uncancel()``. Without that,
      the bounded recovery wait in the CancelledError branch is defeated

    ``QUEUES_LOCK`` is intentionally NOT taken here.

    Contract:
    * ``QUEUES`` is a plain ``dict`` keyed by the per-flow UUID hex stored on
      the flow as ``_agui_queue_key``. CPython's GIL makes ``dict.get(k)``
      atomic at the bytecode level — we cannot observe a half-constructed
      mapping. This assumes a CPython-with-GIL interpreter; free-threaded
      CPython 3.13+ (PEP 703, opt-in ``--disable-gil``) removes that
      bytecode-atomicity guarantee and would require wrapping the read in a
      ``threading.Lock`` (or a thread-safe mapping). Forward-compat note only —
      the module does not ship free-thread support today.
    * Threading model: crewai's ``CrewAIEventsBus`` emits listener callbacks
      synchronously from whatever call stack raised the event. Our events are
      raised from within ``kickoff_async`` — which we ``await`` on the event
      loop — so in practice every listener callback fires on the loop thread
      and ``put_nowait`` is the right primitive. If crewai ever invokes the
      bus from a worker thread (a future background-executor feature), every
      ``put_nowait`` call site in
      ``FastAPICrewFlowEventListener.setup_listeners`` must be revisited and
      converted to ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe``.
    * This function is called from TWO contexts:
      (a) Synchronous crewai event-listener callbacks. Those run on the event
          loop thread but via synchronous call stacks where we cannot
          ``await`` — hence no ``QUEUES_LOCK`` acquisition.
      (b) The async endpoint code paths, which always take ``QUEUES_LOCK`` for
          writes (``create_queue``, ``delete_queue``) but not reads.
    * The one race that remains is SEMANTIC rather than data-structural: a
      late listener callback that fires after ``delete_queue`` removed the
      entry observes ``None`` and silently no-ops. This is intended — an event
      for a torn-down flow has nowhere to land. ``_cancel_and_join`` teardown
      widens the window during which late callbacks can arrive after delete
      but does not change the semantics.
    * A flow that was never registered with ``create_queue`` will not carry
      the ``_agui_queue_key`` attribute; we default to ``None`` and the
      ``get`` returns ``None`` as intended.

                This is an ``async def`` generator (``yield``s encoded
                frames); it does NOT return a boolean. Callers iterate with
                ``async for`` and rely on their outer control flow to decide
                what happens after the drain. An empty iteration means either
                (a) the ``None`` sentinel was consumed or (b) the queue
                quiesced within the drain budget.

                Algorithm:
                * Each pass drains any currently-queued items via non-blocking
                  ``get_nowait``. If the ``None`` sentinel appears we stop
                  immediately.
                * After each pass we yield one scheduler tick
                  (``asyncio.sleep(0)``) — UNCONDITIONALLY, regardless of
                  whether the pass drained anything — so any ``call_soon`` /
                  ``call_later(0)`` chained by a listener has a chance to run
                  before we probe again.
                * We loop up to ``_DRAIN_MAX_PASSES`` passes or until the
                  cumulative ``_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECONDS`` wall clock is exhausted
                  — whichever comes first. This covers listener chains that
                  need multiple scheduler ticks to materialise their enqueue
                  (e.g. a listener callback that itself schedules another
                  ``call_soon``). A single-tick early-return would drop
                  late-arriving items needing more than one ``sleep(0)`` tick.
                * Budget-exhaustion mid-pass is logged at DEBUG so operators
                  can correlate dropped events; the hard pass cap is likewise
                  logged so a pathological listener that keeps enqueueing
                  forever is visible.

    Returns True only when the stream reached natural exhaustion. False means a
    producer is still running with nobody left to read it, which on the
    conversational path is the difference between a completed turn and an
    abandoned worker.

    Three distinct conditions produce that False and the return value cannot tell
    them apart, so each is logged: a healthy-but-slow tail that outlived the grace
    (DEBUG, routine on a successful conversational turn), an upstream error, and a
    worker that aborted its turn instead of finishing it (both WARNING, since the
    tail's real outcome is discarded here and can never reach the wire).

    crewai enqueues its end sentinel only AFTER ``kickoff_async`` fully returns —
    result recorded, trace batch finalized — see ``create_async_frame_generator``
    in crewai's ``utilities/streaming.py``: the ``flow_finished`` FRAME is emitted
    from inside ``kickoff_async``, but the ``None`` that ends the iterator lands
    only in the run task's ``finally``, one or more loop turns later.

    If the driver ``break``s the instant RUN_FINISHED is emitted and lets the
    ``finally`` ``aclose()`` the session, crewai's frame generator is
    ``GeneratorExit``-ed at its ``yield`` and its OWN ``finally`` ``task.cancel()``s
    the still-finalizing kickoff task — on EVERY happy-path run (verified against
    the 1.15.7 wheel: the session ends ``is_cancelled=True`` with no ``result``).
    Draining to natural ``StopAsyncIteration`` instead lets the run task reach its
    end sentinel, so the subsequent ``aclose()`` is a no-op and the kickoff is
    never cancelled mid-finalization. This is the frame-path analogue of the
    legacy path's ``_cancel_and_join(allow_grace=True)`` happy-path window.

    Bounded by ``_CANCEL_GRACE_SECONDS`` so a pathological finalization cannot
    stall teardown — on grace expiry we return and the ``finally``'s ``aclose()``
    force-cancels the tail (today's behavior, but only after the grace). Trailing
    frames are DISCARDED: emitting any wire event after RUN_FINISHED would violate
    the AG-UI run lifecycle, and a late upstream error can no longer become a
    RUN_ERROR, so it is kept off the wire and logged instead.

    """StreamFrame-path driver: drive one flow turn and yield encoded AG-UI events.

    Two transports, one translation seam. Without ``conversational_turn`` the
    driver opens ``flow.astream`` and iterates crewai's own async session. With
    one, crewai offers no async turn API, so the driver calls the public
    ``flow.stream_turn(message, session_id=threadId)`` and wraps the SYNCHRONOUS
    ``StreamSession`` it returns in a ``SyncStreamSessionAdapter``, which pumps it
    from a worker thread. Everything below the transport (translator, RUN_ERROR
    taxonomy, ceiling, raw-event parking, teardown) is shared.

    The conversational transport is what the containment machinery exists for,
    because Python cannot kill that worker thread:

    * a worker-pool LEASE is acquired before the flow is touched at all
      (``acquire_conversation_worker``), since crewai spawns its thread on the
      first frame read and a refusal after that point refuses nothing. It is keyed
      by (flow, threadId): the registry is process-wide, one process serves many
      endpoints, and the id is the client's, so keying on the id alone would let
      one flow's abandoned turn refuse another's. The adapter takes ownership of
      the lease and releases it when the worker really ends, not when the request
      does; every path that fails before the adapter exists gives the slot back
      itself;
    * one ``AbandonmentSignal`` per run is handed to every layer that can still
      publish or persist after this generator unwinds (the worker, the raw-event
      sink, the persistence overlay). It is set in the ``finally`` unless the run
      reached a terminal event or the stream exhausted, so a turn that FINISHED
      is never abandoned: it still owes its persistence writes and its tail;
    * a second, broader ``request_torn_down`` event gates the request-owned
      buffers alone. Once the generator has unwound, terminal or not, nothing may
      park into them again. Abandonment cannot serve that purpose, precisely
      because a completed turn's tail keeps emitting and is never abandoned.

    The astream path is the behavior-preserving replacement for
    ``_run_flow_event_stream`` on crewai >= 1.6. Instead of a process-global bus
    listener enqueuing onto a per-flow
    ``asyncio.Queue`` (keyed by a uuid stamped on the Flow), we consume the
    ordered ``StreamFrame`` envelopes crewai's scoped stream sink produces and
    map them through the single ``StreamFrameTranslator`` seam.

    Every must-survive behavior of the legacy path is preserved by REUSING the
    same helpers:

    * the five-code RUN_ERROR taxonomy (``AGUI_CREWAI_FLOW_TIMEOUT`` /
      ``AGUI_CREWAI_UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`` / ``AGUI_CREWAI_FLOW_ERROR_<Class>`` /
      ``AGUI_CREWAI_CONVERSATION_CAPACITY`` /
      ``AGUI_CREWAI_CONVERSATION_THREAD_BUSY``) via ``_CeilingExceeded`` /
      ``_format_timeout_message`` / ``_sanitize_exception_code``;
    * the wall-clock ceiling + env knobs (``timeout`` is ``_flow_timeout_seconds()``);
    * ``_stamp_correlation_ids`` on every emitted event and
      ``_run_error_extras`` (camelCase wire aliases) on every RUN_ERROR;
    * client-disconnect teardown via ``aclose()`` (see ``_aclose_stream_session``).

    ``flow_context`` is set so the ``sdk.copilotkit_*`` helpers can emit their
    ``Bridged*`` events; those reach the scoped sink synchronously because
    ``event_bus._prepare_event`` calls ``publish_stream_event`` on every
    ``emit``.

    Payload + identity come from the RAW event, not ``frame.data``. We register
    our OWN scoped sink that parks the raw event object keyed by
    ``event.event_id``. Outer-flow lifecycle/method events are parked only when
    ``source is flow_copy`` (so a nested ``crew.kickoff``'s own flow's
    lifecycle/method events, which leak onto this same sink via the copied
    contextvars, are excluded); Crew/Agent lifecycle events are parked
    regardless of source (they are run-scoped and arrive with a non-outer
    source) so the translator can attribute the crew/agent hierarchy. The frame
    stream then supplies ORDERING; for each frame we look
    up the parked raw event by ``frame.id`` and translate it. A frame with no
    parked event is skipped.

    Because ``publish_stream_event`` runs the sink synchronously on ``emit``
    and crewai enqueues the frame via ``loop.call_soon_threadsafe`` (a later
    loop turn), the raw event is ALWAYS parked before its frame is dequeued.

    """Adds a CrewAI endpoint to the FastAPI app.

    ``emit_raw_events`` opts into RAW passthrough: the crewai events this bridge does
    not map (its llm / agent / task / tool channels, nested-flow lifecycle, internals)
    are mirrored onto AG-UI ``RAW`` events. Off by default; ``None`` reads
    ``AGUI_CREWAI_EMIT_RAW_EVENTS``.

    ``emission_shape`` selects the wire shape for text / tool-call output:
    ``"triples"`` (START/CONTENT/END, the default) or ``"chunks"`` (the previous
    CHUNK form); ``None`` reads ``AGUI_CREWAI_EMISSION_SHAPE``. Both it and
    ``emit_raw_events`` resolve at registration, so a bad value fails once at
    startup rather than per request.

    ``conversational=True`` drives CrewAI's public ``stream_turn`` API and maps
    AG-UI ``thread_id`` to CrewAI ``session_id``. It fails loudly when the
    supplied flow has not opted into CrewAI conversational mode.

    Async human-in-the-loop: when the flow pauses on an ``@human_feedback``
    method whose provider raises ``HumanFeedbackPending`` (see
    :data:`ag_ui_crewai.agui_feedback_provider`), the run terminates with an
    AG-UI interrupt and the next request carrying ``RunAgentInput.resume[]``
    resumes it via ``Flow.from_pending`` + ``resume_async``.

    ``emit_interrupt_outcome`` (default False) opts into the structured
    ``RUN_FINISHED.outcome``. CopilotKit < 1.61.2 breaks on it, so it stays off
    by default and the interrupt is surfaced via the legacy ``on_interrupt``
    CUSTOM event. Disabling ``enable_legacy_on_interrupt_event`` forces the
    outcome on so the interrupt is always surfaced by at least one channel.

    IMPORTANT for CopilotKit >= 1.61.2 (``useInterrupt``): resume works only via
    the structured outcome. The legacy ``on_interrupt`` channel renders the
    interrupt but its ``resolve()`` does not send a ``RunAgentInput.resume[]``
    back, so the run re-kicks off and re-pauses in a loop. Pass
    ``emit_interrupt_outcome=True`` (or ``enable_legacy_on_interrupt_event=False``)
    for those clients.

    ``**kwargs`` are forwarded to ``app.post`` (``name``, ``tags``,
    ``operation_id``, ``dependencies``, ``include_in_schema``, ...).

    ``crew`` must be a crew wrapper exposing a ``crew()`` factory (see
    :class:`CrewBaseInstance`) — a ``@CrewBase``-decorated instance or an
    equivalent wrapper — NOT a bare :class:`crewai.Crew`. The deferred
    ``ChatWithCrewFlow`` construction calls ``crew.crew()`` and reads the
    crew name via ``_read_crew_name`` (which accepts either a
    ``@CrewBase``'s ``_crew_name`` or a hand-rolled ``.name``).

    ChatWithCrewFlow construction is deferred to first request because the
    constructor calls crew_chat_generate_crew_chat_inputs which makes an LLM
    call. At import time the LLM mock server may not be running yet.

    ``**kwargs`` are forwarded to ``app.post`` (``name``, ``tags``,
    ``operation_id``, ``dependencies``, ``include_in_schema``, ...).
