        Containment, not cancellation, stated plainly. CrewAI's synchronous
        generator cannot be closed safely from this event-loop thread while its
        worker is executing (Python raises ``ValueError: generator already
        executing``), and Python cannot kill a running thread, so this sets a
        flag and returns. The flag is observed only BETWEEN frames -- after
        ``next()`` returns -- so a provider call that emits nothing never sees
        it, and the turn keeps running until that call and the rest of the Flow
        work finish. What the flag DOES guarantee: from here on the worker
        publishes nothing, parks nothing, and writes no state, and it drains the
        session to exhaustion rather than leaving CrewAI's queue to grow behind a
        blocked join (the frames CrewAI already recorded for the turn stay on its
        session either way). The bound on how long that takes is the provider
        timeout, not this call. The pool slot stays held until the thread ends.

        The run-wide signal is declared abandoned here ONLY when this adapter
        owns it. When a request driver supplied it, that driver alone decides,
        because only it can tell a lost request from a turn that finished: this
        method is also reached after a completed RUN_FINISHED whose worker is
        still appending the assistant message and running its terminal handlers.
        Abandoning there would drop that tail's persistence writes and make the
        next message on the conversation get refused as busy.

        NOT a queue drain contract: once the run is abandoned the worker also
        stops publishing its terminal ``done`` / ``aborted``, deliberately,
        because those belong to a request that no longer exists. Anything that
        consumes this adapter's queue -- directly, or by iterating ``__aiter__``
        past the abandonment -- must therefore stop on the abandonment signal;
        waiting for a terminal item after an abandonment waits forever.
