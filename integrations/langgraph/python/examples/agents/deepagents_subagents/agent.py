"""A deepagents supervisor that delegates to a research subagent which pauses
for human approval (HITL) before finalizing — the interrupt happens INSIDE the
subagent.

This demo exercises AG-UI subagent attribution AND human-in-the-loop via a
LangGraph `interrupt()` raised inside a subagent. The subagent calls the
`request_human_approval` tool, which interrupts; the interrupt propagates to the
top-level run, AG-UI surfaces it as an `on_interrupt` event, the dojo renders an
Approve/Reject prompt (via CopilotKit's `useInterrupt`), and the user's decision
is fed back with `Command(resume=...)` on the same thread so the subagent
continues from where it paused.
