        checkpoint namespace, so every concurrent *subagent* stream derives a
        distinct id and thus a distinct lane — the case this fix targets.
        Concurrent streams that carry NO subagent identity (e.g. two ordinary
        model nodes or two declared subgraphs fanning out in a hand-built
        graph) all map to "__root__" and would still interleave into one lane;
        that is a pre-existing limitation of attribution-less parallel
        streaming, not something lanes can resolve (there is no id to separate
        them by).

        Gated on emit_subagent_events like every other subagent-aware path:
        with the flag off, everything maps to the root lane, so the streaming
        state behaves exactly as it did before subagent support — including
        concurrent subagents interleaving into one slot. Per-lane slots with
        the flag off would be a (benign) stream-shape change, and the flag's
        contract is byte-identity, not improvement.

          ``finish_reason``. This is the streaming case.
        * ``OnChatModelEnd`` — the aggregated output message. This is the ONLY
          channel when the model does not stream at all (streaming disabled, or
          a tool call answered without streaming): no ``OnChatModelStream``
          event is emitted for such a call, so a stream-only producer reports
          nothing for it. Verified against this package's locked dependencies:
          a non-streaming model reporting 3/2/5 produced no stream event and a
          model-end output carrying the counts.

        A streaming provider reports the SAME usage on BOTH channels under the

        ``usage_run_ids`` records which calls the stream already covered and the

        adds to it — two streamed chunks that each carry usage for one call are
        still summed, matching the TypeScript producer.

        Kept per-call and folded together at the terminal event by

        provider count (string, ``None``, ``NaN``, negative, fractional,
        wider-than-int64) is dropped rather than forwarded: the alternative is a
        ValidationError raised while BUILDING the terminal event, which would
        cost the user the whole run over a token count.

        Nothing usable adds nothing at all — the field is then omitted from the

        Public ids are run-global: the clients reject a second

        snapshot accumulator is keyed by public message id, so two lanes
        presenting the same upstream id crossed their entities into one entry.
        Distinct LangChain runs mint distinct ``lc_run--*`` ids and providers
        mint per-response call ids, so a genuine collision needs upstream to
        repeat itself — nothing guarantees it never does.

        Resolution is a per-(lane, kind) mapping so every reference to the
        same upstream id from the same lane yields the same public id — a
        lane's text START, its tool call's parent_message_id, and its
        on_tool_end result all land on one assistant message, exactly as with
        raw ids. The first lane to present an id keeps it verbatim
        (single-lane streams stay byte-identical, and the raw id is what the
        graph state's own message carries, which the snapshot merge matches
        on); only colliders get a minted id, namespaced by lane so it is
        stable and self-describing.

        Renaming happens at the emission boundary only — graph state keeps the
        raw ids, and every internal correlation (ToolNode dispatch matching,
        ``task_tool_call_ids_by_ns``, on_tool_end lookup) stays raw-keyed.
        Both halves of a public pair (the assistant tool_call and its
        TOOL_CALL_RESULT) resolve through the same lane map, so the client's
        view stays self-consistent.

        Flag-off is untouched by construction: every event maps to the root

        Two sources are merged, both absent from main-graph state:

        1. This run's freshly-streamed subagent messages (``subagent_messages``),
           built from the accumulator.
        2. Prior turns' subagent messages the client echoed back, split out of
           the graph input in ``run`` (``inbound_subagent_messages``). Re-emitting
           them keeps them in the client's display across turns — the client's
           MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT apply is an edit-merge that keeps a message it
           already has in its existing position, so including them here (by id)
           preserves their place without our needing to reconstruct ordering.

        No-op when neither source has anything, so runs without subagents (and
        the declared-``subgraphs`` demo, which never sets a ``subagent_run_id``)

        skipped so the snapshot gains no empty bubbles; tool calls are preserved

        With ``emit_subagent_events`` OFF, source (1) is skipped -- those messages
        already reached the client as the parent's own work, so merging them would
        duplicate them -- but source (2) is still appended with the
        ``subagent_run_id`` STRIPPED. ``run()`` splits inbound subagent messages out
        of the graph input unconditionally (they must never enter supervisor state),
        and the client's snapshot apply is authoritative, so omitting them here made
        the client DELETE every subagent message from prior turns. Stripping the
        attribution keeps them visible as ordinary parent messages, which is exactly
        what the flag-off contract promises: the subagent's output reaches the client
        as the parent's own work.
