    """Recover an ``image_url`` block's AG-UI media type from its data URL's MIME type.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. ``image_url`` is not the image path — it is the fallback path
    for every modality `_standard_block_for` refuses, which is video (no standard
    block converts, in either runtime), audio outside `_OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES`,
    and every URL-sourced item. Reading the block kind literally therefore turned
    an attached video into an ``ImageInputContent`` in MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT,
    permanently: the thread was rewritten, and every later read of it saw an
    image. The outbound leg is deliberately unchanged — see
    :func:`convert_agui_multimodal_to_langchain` — so the fix belongs here.

    The MIME type inside ``data:<mime>;base64,…`` is the original one this adapter
    put there, so on the DATA path the modality is fully recoverable. The mapping
    mirrors how the legacy ``binary`` OUTBOUND leg classifies the same string:
    image/video/audio by major type, everything else a document. Symmetric by
    construction, which is the property that keeps a round trip stable.

    Two cases are NOT recoverable and stay images, which is what they already were:

      1. URL-sourced media. ``image_url`` carries ``{"url": …}`` and nothing else,
         so a video at an https URL arrives with no MIME type and no other signal.
         AG-UI lets a url source declare ``mime_type``, but this adapter cannot put
         it on the wire: extra keys inside a content block are what issue #2100 was
         about (strict OpenAI-compatible providers 400 on "Unexpected keys in a
         message content image dict"), and the outbound shape here is load-bearing.
         Guessing from a file extension is not a signal — signed and extensionless
         CDN URLs are the norm. So a URL-sourced non-image loses its modality, and
         this is the documented limit of this fix rather than something it covers.
      2. A data URL with no MIME type at all (``data:;base64,…``), where there is
         nothing to read. The pre-existing ``image/png`` default applies — see the
         ``or "image/png"`` in `convert_langchain_multimodal_to_agui`, which is
         what the mirrored TypeScript adapter records for the same input. The
         block stays an ``image``, which is what it already was.

    ``metadata.filename`` is lost on this path in both directions regardless — the
    ``image_url`` block has nowhere to carry it.

#      failure an operator cannot diagnose. This covers the drops that have no
#      branch of their own: an item of an UNRECOGNISED TYPE is a drop too, and

# The JS THREW cells are measured: the message is "Audio blocks with source_type
# base64 must have mime type of audio/wav or audio/mp3". The Python cells are
# measured only as far as the request body — that `format` string IS what
# langchain-core puts on the wire, with no exception and no warning. The ✗ itself
# is an inference, not a live API call: `format` is a two-value enum in the OpenAI
# SDK (`format: 'wav' | 'mp3'`), so anything else is out-of-enum and the API
# rejects it. Nobody has re-run these against a live key from this repo.
#
# Two things fall out of that table, and this map exists for both.
#
# FIRST: `audio/mpeg` is the IANA-registered MIME type for MP3, and it is what
# browsers, OS file pickers and `file(1)` report for a `.mp3`. It is therefore the
# single most common audio attachment on the web, and it is NOT on the provider's
# allow-list — `audio/mp3` is, which is the non-standard spelling. Refusing
# `audio/mpeg` would leave the common case permanently on `image_url` (a
# guaranteed provider 400 for a non-image part); passing it through unchanged
# sends an invalid enum value here and kills the run inside the translator in the
# TypeScript adapter. Rewriting the spelling is the only outcome where an MP3
# actually reaches the model, so this map normalizes rather than merely narrows.
#
# SECOND: this runtime's failure mode is WORSE than the TypeScript one and is
# entirely silent. `convert_to_openai_data_block` takes `mime_type.split("/")[-1]`
# verbatim, so `audio/ogg` becomes `format: "ogg"` and goes out over the wire —
# no local error, just a 400 from the API with nothing pointing back here. A case
# difference or a `;codecs=` parameter is enough to produce that on a type BOTH
# runtimes could otherwise have handled. Normalizing to a canonical spelling
# before emitting removes the divergence at the source: after this map, the only
# `mime_type` either runtime ever puts on an audio block is `audio/wav` or
# `audio/mp3`, which this naive split and the TypeScript parser both reduce to the
# same accepted enum value.
#
# Keys are the case-folded MIME type with any parameters stripped (MIME types are
# case-insensitive per RFC 2045 §5.1, so `AUDIO/WAV` is a legal spelling of a
# supported type and must not be treated as an unsupported one). The WAV aliases
# are the registered and de-facto spellings of the same RIFF/WAVE container; they
# name a format the provider accepts and differ only in how they are written,
# which is the same defect as `audio/mpeg`.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, deliberate: THE REWRITE IS VISIBLE IN THE THREAD. The normalized
# spelling is what the return leg reads back, so a client that sent `audio/mpeg`
# finds `audio/mp3` recorded against its own message in the next
# MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT — an adapter-invented value attributed to the client, which is
# the same defect `_supplied_filename` strips on the way back for a DERIVED
# FILENAME. That precedent does not transfer here, for three reasons:
#
#   1. NOTHING TO RECOGNISE. `_derive_filename` is a function of a DIFFERENT field
#      (MIME type -> filename), so recomputing it tests a real claim. This map is a
#      function of the field itself, it is many-to-one, and its image overlaps its
#      domain — `audio/mp3` and `audio/wav` map to themselves. A returned
#      `audio/wav` has six preimages and a returned `audio/mp3` has two, so
#      recomputing identifies every provider-acceptable audio block, rewritten or
#      not, rather than identifying a fabrication.
#   2. NOTHING TO STRIP. The precedent's remedy is to make the field ABSENT and let
#      the outbound leg re-derive it. An AG-UI data source REQUIRES a `mime_type`,
#      and the inbound converter's answer for a missing one is
#      `application/octet-stream` — which loses the modality, so the NEXT send
#      would no longer see audio at all and would fall back to `image_url`.
#      Stripping is strictly worse than recording `audio/mp3`.
#   3. SUBSTITUTING BACK JUST MOVES THE VICTIM. Mapping `audio/mp3` ->
#      `audio/mpeg` on the return leg would rewrite a block that genuinely said
#      `audio/mp3` — which a graph can legitimately produce, and which the parity
#      table treats as well-formed inbound content. That is the same invention
#      pointed the other way, and it addresses one of the six rewrites: the wav
#      aliases are not recoverable at all.
#
# What makes leaving it acceptable is that the round trip is STABLE rather than
# drifting: `audio/mp3` re-normalizes to `audio/mp3`, so every later send carries
# the identical MIME type, and the recorded value is a legal spelling of the same
# format with the modality — the thing this converter exists to preserve — intact.
# Pinned by "an emitted audio MIME type is stable across a second send".
#
# Kept in lockstep with `OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES` in the TypeScript adapter. A
# divergence here is the class of bug this converter exists to fix.

    """The ``(mime_type, base64_payload)`` inside a ``data:`` URL, or ``None``.

    WHY THIS EXISTS. A ``data:`` URL is url-SHAPED but it is not a reference —
    RFC 2397 puts the bytes in the URL itself. Classifying one as a URL source is
    what sent a PDF to the provider as ``image_url``: `_inline_media_data` refuses
    url sources for the standard-block path because a REMOTE url raises inside
    both translators, and a data URL was being swept up by that same rule even
    though the identical payload, handed to the translator as an inline block,
    converts to a ``file`` / ``input_audio`` part.

    WHAT COUNTS. Only ``data:[<mediatype>][;…];base64,<non-empty payload>``.
    Three near-misses are deliberately NOT read as inline data, and each one falls
    through to the caller's pre-existing url handling rather than being guessed
    at:

      1. NO ``;base64`` PARAMETER (``data:text/plain,hello``). RFC 2397's default
         encoding is percent-encoded text, not base64. The standard media block's
         payload key is base64 BY DEFINITION — both translators feed it straight
         into ``data:<mime>;base64,…`` — so putting percent-encoded text there
         would hand the provider a payload that decodes to garbage. A
         wrong-but-quiet attachment is worse than the ``image_url`` this leaves it
         as.
      2. NO COMMA (``data:application/pdf;base64``) — not a data URL at all,
         there is no payload delimiter.
      3. AN EMPTY PAYLOAD (``data:application/pdf;base64,``). Same rule the
         inbound ``image_url`` branch already applies: a block whose payload is
         the empty string is an attachment pointing at nothing.

    ``startswith("data:")`` is CASE-SENSITIVE, matching the ``image_url`` branch
    of `convert_langchain_multimodal_to_agui` byte for byte. URI schemes are
    case-insensitive per RFC 3986 §3.1, so ``DATA:`` is a legal spelling this
    declines — but this file already declined it in the one place it looked for a
    data URL, and one rule applied everywhere is worth more here than a second,
    better rule applied in one place. The ``;base64`` parameter itself IS matched
    case-insensitively, because RFC 2045 §6.1 makes the encoding token
    case-insensitive and ``;Base64`` occurs in the wild.

    A ``data`` source obviously carries them. A ``url`` source carries them too
    WHEN THE URL IS A ``data:`` URL — that is the whole point of this function,
    and the defect it fixes: those bytes were being classified as a remote
    reference and sent to the provider as ``image_url``.

    A REMOTE url source returns ``None`` and is left exactly where it was. That
    rule is not squeamishness, it is measured: a ``source_type: "url"`` standard
    block raises here and throws in the TypeScript runtime for audio, document and
    video alike, so promoting one would turn a degraded request into a dead run.
    (NOT true of a url-sourced ``image`` standard block, which both runtimes
    convert — but images have no row in `_STANDARD_BLOCK_TYPES` and never take
    this path.)

    The MIME type INSIDE the data URL wins over one declared alongside it. RFC
    2397 §2 makes the mediatype a description of the payload that follows it in
    the same string, where a ``mime_type`` on the source describes the reference;
    when the two disagree the one attached to the bytes is the one the provider
    has to be told. This is also what the ``image_url`` return leg already does —
    it recovers the modality by reading the MIME type back out of the data URL and
    ignores everything else. A data URL with an OMITTED mediatype
    (``data:;base64,…``) has nothing to say, so the source's own ``mime_type`` is
    used.

    THE PAYLOAD ITSELF IS CHECKED, not just its presence. ``value`` is declared
    ``str``, and pydantic refuses ``None`` and a non-string AT THE BOUNDARY — but
    only where a caller went THROUGH validation, and the EMPTY STRING it accepts
    outright (measured 2026-08-25 on pydantic 2.12.5 / ag-ui-protocol 0.1.19:
    ``InputContentDataSource(type="data", value="", mime_type="application/pdf")``
    constructs). The three validation-bypassing routes THE MALFORMED-INPUT
    CONTRACT already declares in scope all reach here carrying whatever they were
    given — ``model_construct``, plain attribute assignment (the source models do
    not set ``validate_assignment``), and ``model_copy(update=…)``, which pydantic
    documents as unvalidated — and this value is what goes on the provider request
    as the media block's ``base64``. Emitting ``base64: None`` sends the model an
    attachment with no bytes in it, quietly: nothing raised, but nothing was
    dropped or logged either, so the operator sees a request that merely fails to
    mention the file. An unusable payload is an ABSENT payload — the same rule
    this file already applies to a MIME type and to a filename — so it returns
    ``None`` here, `_media_source_to_url` refuses it too, and the caller drops the
    one item with the one warning it already emits for a source it cannot use.

    ``None`` means the combination has no standard block that survives the

    ``mime_type`` is the type of the INLINE BYTES, as `_inline_media_data`
    resolved it — not the source's declared one, which for a data URL describes
    the reference rather than the payload.

    Audio is the only modality whose MIME type is rewritten: the type that goes on
    the wire is the normalized spelling, not the one the client sent. A document
    passes its own through untouched, because `file.file_data` carries it inside a
    data URL where no enum constrains it — but a document with NO usable MIME type
    still has to name one, because the translator interpolates whatever it is
    given straight into that URL. Measured 2026-08-25 on langchain-core 1.2.13,
    through `convert_to_openai_messages`, a `file` block reaches the provider as:

      * ``mime_type=""``   -> ``file.file_data: "data:;base64,<payload>"``
      * ``mime_type=None`` -> ``file.file_data: "data:None;base64,<payload>"``
      * ``mime_type`` key absent -> ``KeyError: 'mime_type'``, which escapes the
        whole message conversion

    The empty case is not a part with a missing type, it is a part with the WRONG
    one — RFC 2397 §2 defines an omitted mediatype as
    ``text/plain;charset=US-ASCII``, so a PDF's bytes go out asserting they are
    ASCII text. The ``None`` case is worse still (the literal string ``None`` as a
    media type), and the absent case is not a degraded request at all but a raise.
    Note the divergence from the mirrored TypeScript adapter, where all three of
    those spellings produce ``data:;base64,`` and none of them raise.

    The MIME type is read through `_first_non_empty_string` for the reason spelled
    out on `_normalized_audio_mime_type`: the declared ``str`` is not enforced at
    this boundary, ``or`` accepts a non-string, and handing one on to
    `_derive_filename` raised an AttributeError out of the whole message-list
    conversion — rule 1 of THE MALFORMED-INPUT CONTRACT. An unusable MIME type is
    an absent one, so a document carrying one gets the same
    `application/octet-stream` as a document carrying none, which is what the
    mirrored TypeScript adapter already answered for it.

    `application/octet-stream` is this file's existing answer for unidentified
    bytes, and the two legs are inverses, so it applies here rather than merely
    being available: `_agui_media_from_standard_block` already normalizes a
    MIME-less inbound base64 block to exactly this string, and
    `_FILENAME_EXTENSIONS` already maps it to the `bin` that `_derive_filename`
    independently derives for a MIME-less document. Without it the same attachment
    is `application/octet-stream` inbound and `""` outbound; with it the round trip
    is exact and the emitted MIME type and the emitted filename finally agree about
    what the file is.

    document on the next MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT. An omitted mediatype reads back as an
    image, which is what the item already was.

    THE PAYLOAD IS READ THROUGH `_first_non_empty_string` ON BOTH SOURCE KINDS,
    for the same reason the MIME type beside it already is, and through the same
    validation-bypassing routes (`_inline_media_data` lists them):

      * a ``data`` source carrying ``None`` / ``42`` / ``""`` was interpolated
        STRAIGHT INTO the data URL — ``data:image/png;base64,None`` is a payload
        the provider will try to decode, and the empty-payload spelling
        ``data:image/png;base64,`` is the exact string `_parse_base64_data_url`
        refuses to read back as bytes, so the attachment was already unreadable by
        this adapter's own rule. It also DIVERGED on prose: this runtime wrote
        ``None`` where the TypeScript adapter wrote ``null``.
      * a ``url`` source carrying a non-string was returned VERBATIM, putting a
        number or a dict under ``image_url.url`` on the provider request. That one
        diverged on OUTCOME: ``{}`` is falsy here and truthy in TypeScript, so the
        same item was dropped by one runtime and kept by the other.

    Both collapse onto ``None``, which is the one thing the caller already knows
    how to announce.

def _derive_filename(mime_type: str | None) -> str:
    """A filename for a `file` block whose AG-UI item did not carry one.

    Not cosmetic. `@langchain/openai` THROWS on a file block with no filename
    ("a filename or name or title is needed via meta-data for OpenAI when working
    with multimodal blocks" — measured 2026-08-25 on `@langchain/openai` 1.2.0),
    so the document path has to carry one for the claimed support to be real.

    langchain-core does not throw, and does not merely drop the key either:
    measured on 1.2.13, a nameless file block warns ("OpenAI may require a
    filename for file uploads…") and the part goes out carrying the PLACEHOLDER
    ``filename: "LC_AUTOGENERATED"`` — i.e. the provider is told the user attached
    a file by that name. Substituting a derived name is an improvement on both.

    The two runtimes do NOT emit the same block: this one emits ``base64`` /
    ``mime_type`` / top-level ``filename``, the TypeScript adapter emits
    ``source_type`` / ``data`` / ``mime_type`` / ``metadata.filename``. Both run
    the same derivation — `deriveFilename` there is kept identical to this — so
    an attachment gets the same name whichever runtime sent it.

    THE TWO BLOCKS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. An earlier revision of this paragraph
    said they were — "both translate to the same provider part (verified through
    both real translators)" — and only three of the four combinations hold.
    Measured 2026-08-25 with an ``application/pdf`` file block, on langchain-core
    1.2.13 (through `convert_to_openai_messages`) and `@langchain/openai` 1.2.0 +
    `@langchain/core` 1.1.40 (through `ChatOpenAI` with a stub `fetch`):

                           + file.filename        + file.filename

    The failing cell is the direction that does not occur. JS gates translation on
    ``isDataContentBlock``, which tests ``source_type`` and nothing else, and this
    adapter never emits that key. It stays LATENT because neither adapter's output
    crosses into the other's translator, and for asymmetric reasons:

      * `LangGraphAgent` here takes an IN-PROCESS ``CompiledStateGraph``, not a
        remote deployment, so a block this function builds is only ever handed to
        langchain-core Python — the ✓ cell on row 1. Nothing in either package
        routes row 1 into the JS column.
      * The TypeScript adapter drives a LangGraph SERVER over
        `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`, and that server is usually the Python one, so
        ITS block does have to translate in both columns — which is why it emits
        the ``source_type`` family and why row 2 is measured in both.

    So the surviving claim is the narrower one: each block produces the same
    provider part through the translator its own runtime actually reaches, and the
    TypeScript adapter's block additionally survives this one. Revisit if this
    adapter ever grows a remote-server transport.

    THE SUBTYPE IS NOT THE EXTENSION. It coincides with one often enough to look
    like a rule — ``application/pdf``, ``text/csv`` — and then does not:
    ``text/plain`` is not ``.plain``, ``audio/mpeg`` is not ``.mpeg``, and
    ``application/vnd.api+json`` is not ``.vnd.api``. So the subtype is a LAST
    resort here, taken only when it survives being checked:

      1. `_FILENAME_EXTENSIONS` answers the types whose subtype is wrong.
      2. A structured-syntax suffix (RFC 6838 §4.2.8) names the underlying
         format, so ``+json`` / ``+xml`` wins over the vendor tree in front of it.
      3. Otherwise the registration-tree prefix (``vnd.``, ``prs.``, ``x-``,
         ``x.``) is stripped, because it is a namespace, not an extension.
      4. What is left has to LOOK like an extension. ``ms-excel`` and
         ``openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document`` do not, and
         a dot inside the "extension" turns ``attachment.vnd.ms-excel`` into a
         file apparently named ``attachment.vnd``. Anything implausible becomes
         ``.bin``, which is what an unidentified byte stream is called.

    MIME types are case-insensitive (RFC 2045 §5.1), so the lookup is case-folded.

    NO non-string guard here, unlike `_normalized_audio_mime_type`, and that is
    load-bearing rather than an oversight: ``str | None`` is ENFORCED for every
    caller by the two functions that resolve a MIME type before this one is
    reached — `_standard_block_for` substitutes for an unusable one and
    `_read_incoming_media_block` reads it through `_first_non_empty_string`. The
    TypeScript `deriveFilename` is guarded by the same two, so the pair agrees.
    Widen this signature and the guard has to come with it.

    Handles the new typed content classes (ImageInputContent, AudioInputContent,
    VideoInputContent, DocumentInputContent) as well as legacy BinaryInputContent
    for backwards compatibility.

    Inline documents, and inline audio IN A FORMAT THE PROVIDER CAN CARRY, use the
    standard block for their modality (`audio`, `file`), because the block KIND is
    what providers validate: a PDF sent as `image_url` carries its real MIME type
    inside the data URL and is still rejected —

        openai.BadRequestError: 400 - Invalid MIME type. Only image types are
        supported. (code: invalid_image_format)

    — which killed the run rather than degrading it. Routing every modality
    through `image_url` was correct when this converter was written (#1457) and
    stopped being correct once langchain-core grew standard multimodal blocks.

    The floor this package DECLARES is langchain-core 1.2.1: `pyproject.toml`
    asks for `langchain>=1.2.0`, and langchain 1.2.0 requires
    `langchain-core<2.0.0,>=1.2.1` (read off its PyPI metadata, 2026-08-25). An
    earlier revision of this docstring said 1.2.10; that is the floor of the
    langchain version `uv.lock` happens to resolve, not of the range. Everything
    documented in this file was MEASURED on langchain-core 1.2.13 — the locked
    version — and has not been re-measured against 1.2.1.

    Everything else — images, video, any URL-sourced media, and audio in a format
    outside `_OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES` — keeps `image_url`, because the standard
    block for those combinations throws inside the TypeScript translator, and here
    either raises (video, and every URL-sourced block) or forwards an invalid
    `format` enum to the API (audio only). See `_STANDARD_BLOCK_TYPES` for the
    measured table.

    Audio MIME types are NORMALIZED, not merely filtered: `audio/mpeg` — the
    standard type for MP3 and the commonest audio attachment there is — is emitted
    as the `audio/mp3` spelling the provider's enum actually lists. See
    `_OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES`.

    Apart from `metadata.filename`, which is a documented field of the file
    block, AG-UI ``InputContent.metadata`` is intentionally NOT copied onto the
    content blocks: these blocks are passed straight to the model, and a
    non-standard top-level ``metadata`` key makes strict OpenAI-compatible
    providers reject the request with a 400 ("Unexpected keys in a message
    content image dict"). See issue #2100.
