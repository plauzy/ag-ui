"""Shared test helpers for ag-ui-langgraph integration tests.

These helpers build lightweight ``LangGraphAgent`` fixtures backed by
``MagicMock``/``AsyncMock`` stand-ins so tests can exercise agent logic in
isolation, without spinning up a real graph or hitting any network.

It also binds the multimodal content-part classes under 1.0's names whichever
name the installed SDK actually exports — see THE CONTENT-PART NAMES below.

# ── THE CONTENT-PART NAMES ────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# AG-UI 1.0 renamed the multimodal content parts — ``TextInputContent`` became
# ``TextPart``, ``ImageInputContent`` became ``ImagePart``, and so on, with
# ``InputContentDataSource``/``InputContentUrlSource`` becoming
# ``DataSource``/``UrlSource`` — and kept every old name as an ALIAS OF THE SAME
# CLASS. Nothing breaks at runtime, so this is invisible to the code; it is only
# visible to anything that reads a NAME.
#
# These tests run against two different SDKs. The locked ``langgraph-python``
# lane installs this repo's ``sdks/python``, which exports both vocabularies.
# The ``langgraph-python-declared-floor`` lane installs the published floor out
# of ``pyproject.toml``, which exports only the OLD names. So the tests must not
# import either vocabulary directly: the new names are absent under the floor,
# and the old ones are the vocabulary 1.0 retired.
#
# Binding the new names to whatever the installed SDK has resolves that once,
# here, and lets every test read in 1.0's vocabulary without pinning a version.

# ── THE `file` PART SOURCE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# 1.0 gave `PartSource` a THIRD arm after the rename above: `{"type": "file",
# "value", provider?, mimeType?}` — bytes that ALREADY LIVE AT A MODEL PROVIDER,
# named by a handle that provider issued (an OpenAI/Anthropic file id, a Gemini
# file URI). No bytes travel with one and nothing may fetch it: `value` is
# opaque and is expressly NOT a URL.
#
# Unlike the classes above this one has no older name to fall back to — it is
# new, not renamed — and the published floor the
# `langgraph-python-declared-floor` lane installs predates it. So the fallback
# is a local stand-in of the same SHAPE rather than another alias. The adapter
# matches this source by its `type` discriminator rather than by class, so both
# lanes exercise the same branch, and the binding flips to the real class as
# soon as the SDK carrying it is released.

# literally named ``ImageInputContent``, so a harness that derived its label
# from ``__name__`` would compare ``"ImageInputContent"`` against a table
# written in 1.0's vocabulary and fail on the installed SDK version rather than
# on adapter behaviour. Identity does not move when the alias does.

# from the protocol rather than renamed, ``ag_ui_langgraph.utils`` owns whatever
