// The legacy binary part left @ag-ui/core in 1.0; this boundary still reads
// it (see utils.ts), so the tests type it locally.
//
// Hence the `as LegacyBinaryInputContent as unknown as ContentPart` on the fixtures
// below, which is two different things in one line.
//
// `as unknown as ContentPart` is the half the compiler requires: 1.0's
// ContentPart union has no `binary` member, so a direct cast is an error and
// TypeScript's own advice is to launder through `unknown`. On its own it would
// build — `{}` would too, which is the point of the other half.
//
// `as LegacyBinaryInputContent` names what the literal is SUPPOSED to be, so a typo'd
// `mimetype` or a numeric `mimeType` fails to compile instead of quietly
// becoming a free-form object. Today every test here also pins its own output
// tightly enough to catch that, so this half is a guard rail rather than a
// load-bearing check — keep it when adding a fixture whose assertion is only
// that the part was DROPPED, where a malformed literal would be dropped too and
// the test would pass for the wrong reason.

  // The distinction the second rule turns on: a DROP is logged, a KEPT block is

  // silent one, which is how every past divergence here survived review.
