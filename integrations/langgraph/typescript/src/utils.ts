/**
 * The audio MIME types an `input_audio` part can actually carry, mapped to the
 * ONE spelling the provider accepts for each.
 *
 * `input_audio.format` is an enum of exactly two values — `"wav" | "mp3"` in the
 * OpenAI SDK's own `ChatCompletionContentPartInputAudio.InputAudio` — and both
 * runtimes derive that string from the block's `mime_type`. So the constraint is
 * not "audio converts": it is "audio converts for two subtypes, spelled the way
 * the provider spells them".
 *
 * READ THE TABLE AS "WITHOUT THIS MAP". It records what a RAW `audio` standard
 * block carrying that MIME type does — which is the thing this map exists to
 * prevent, NOT what this adapter emits today. Downstream of this map the only
 * spellings that ever reach a translator are `audio/wav` and `audio/mp3`, so
 * re-measuring means handing the raw block to the translator directly, not
 * running an AG-UI item through this converter. Measured 2026-08-25 on
 * `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` (which resolves `openai@6.10.0`) via `ChatOpenAI`
 * with a stub `fetch`, and `langchain-core@1.2.13` via
 * `convert_to_openai_messages`:
 *
 *   AG-UI mimeType     JS (@langchain/openai)     Python (langchain-core)
 *   -----------------  -------------------------  --------------------------
 *   audio/wav          format "wav" ✓             format "wav" ✓
 *   audio/mp3          format "mp3" ✓             format "mp3" ✓
 *   audio/mpeg         THREW                      format "mpeg" ✗
 *   audio/ogg          THREW                      format "ogg" ✗
 *   audio/aac          THREW                      format "aac" ✗
 *   audio/webm         THREW                      format "webm" ✗

 *   AUDIO/WAV          THREW                      format "WAV" ✗
 *   audio/wav;codecs=1 format "wav" ✓             format "wav;codecs=1" ✗
 *
 * The JS THREW cells are measured: the message is "Audio blocks with source_type
 * base64 must have mime type of audio/wav or audio/mp3". The Python ✗ cells are
 * measured only as far as the request body — that `format` string IS what
 * langchain-core puts on the wire. The ✗ itself is an inference, not a live API
 * call: `format` is a two-value enum in the OpenAI SDK (`format: 'wav' | 'mp3'`,
 * read out of `openai@6.10.0`), so anything else is out-of-enum and the API
 * rejects it. Nobody has re-run these against a live key from this repo.
 *
 * Two things fall out of that table, and this map exists for both.
 *
 * FIRST: `audio/mpeg` is the IANA-registered MIME type for MP3, and it is what
 * browsers, OS file pickers and `file(1)` report for a `.mp3`. It is therefore
 * the single most common audio attachment on the web, and it is NOT on the
 * provider's allow-list — `audio/mp3` is, which is the non-standard spelling.
 * Refusing `audio/mpeg` would leave the common case permanently on `image_url`
 * (a guaranteed provider 400 for a non-image part); passing it through unchanged
 * kills the JS run inside the translator and sends Python an invalid enum value.
 * Rewriting the spelling is the only outcome where an MP3 actually reaches the
 * model, so this map normalizes rather than merely narrows.
 *
 * SECOND: the two runtimes disagree about everything they do NOT accept. JS
 * parses the MIME type and throws on an unlisted subtype; Python takes
 * `mime_type.split("/")[-1]` verbatim and forwards it, so a bad type dies
 * locally in one runtime and at the API in the other — and a case difference or
 * a `;codecs=` parameter is enough to split them on a type BOTH could have
 * handled. Normalizing to a canonical spelling before emitting removes that
 * divergence at the source: after this map, the only `mime_type` either runtime
 * ever sees on an audio block is `audio/wav` or `audio/mp3`, which JS's parser
 * and Python's naive split both reduce to the same accepted enum value.
 *
 * Keys are the case-folded MIME type with any parameters stripped (MIME types
 * are case-insensitive per RFC 2045 §5.1, so `AUDIO/WAV` is a legal spelling of
 * a supported type and must not be treated as an unsupported one). The WAV
 * aliases are the registered and de-facto spellings of the same RIFF/WAVE
 * container; they name a format the provider accepts and differ only in how they
 * are written, which is the same defect as `audio/mpeg`.
 *
 * A `Map` rather than an object literal, for the reason spelled out on
 * {@link AGUI_MEDIA_TYPES}: the key is derived from a client-supplied MIME
 * string, and an object literal answers `"constructor"` with an inherited
 * function. Here that would be a function handed on as the emitted `mime_type`.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, deliberate: THE REWRITE IS VISIBLE IN THE THREAD. The normalized
 * spelling is what the return leg reads back, so a client that sent `audio/mpeg`
 * finds `audio/mp3` recorded against its own message in the next
 * MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT — an adapter-invented value attributed to the client, which
 * is the same defect {@link suppliedFilename} strips on the way back for a
 * DERIVED FILENAME. That precedent does not transfer here, for three reasons:
 *
 *   1. NOTHING TO RECOGNISE. `deriveFilename` is a function of a DIFFERENT field
 *      (MIME type -> filename), so recomputing it tests a real claim. This map is
 *      a function of the field itself, it is many-to-one, and its image overlaps
 *      its domain — `audio/mp3` and `audio/wav` map to themselves. A returned
 *      `audio/wav` has six preimages and a returned `audio/mp3` has two, so
 *      recomputing identifies every provider-acceptable audio block, rewritten or
 *      not, rather than identifying a fabrication.
 *   2. NOTHING TO STRIP. The precedent's remedy is to make the field ABSENT and
 *      let the outbound leg re-derive it. An AG-UI data source REQUIRES a
 *      `mimeType`, and the inbound converter's answer for a missing one is
 *      `application/octet-stream` — which loses the modality, so the NEXT send
 *      would no longer see audio at all and would fall back to `image_url`.
 *      Stripping is strictly worse than recording `audio/mp3`.
 *   3. SUBSTITUTING BACK JUST MOVES THE VICTIM. Mapping `audio/mp3` ->
 *      `audio/mpeg` on the return leg would rewrite a block that genuinely said
 *      `audio/mp3` — which a graph can legitimately produce, and which the parity
 *      table treats as well-formed inbound content. That is the same invention
 *      pointed the other way, and it addresses one of the six rewrites: the wav
 *      aliases are not recoverable at all.
 *
 * What makes leaving it acceptable is that the round trip is STABLE rather than
 * drifting: `audio/mp3` re-normalizes to `audio/mp3`, so every later send carries
 * the identical MIME type, and the recorded value is a legal spelling of the same
 * format with the modality — the thing this converter exists to preserve —
 * intact. Pinned by "an emitted audio MIME type is stable across a second send".
 *
 * Kept in lockstep with `_OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES` in the Python adapter. A
 * divergence here is the class of bug this converter exists to fix.
 *
 * Revisit when `input_audio.format` grows a third value. It has not: still
 * `'wav' | 'mp3'` in `openai@6.10.0` (what `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` resolves)
 * and in `openai@7.5.0`, checked 2026-08-25.

 * The MIME type and base64 payload carried INSIDE a `data:` URL, or `null` if
 * this string is not one this adapter can read as inline bytes.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. A `data:` URL is url-SHAPED but it is not a reference — RFC
 * 2397 puts the bytes in the URL itself. Classifying one as a URL source is what
 * sent a PDF to the provider as `image_url`: {@link inlineMediaData} refuses url
 * sources for the standard-block path because a REMOTE url throws inside both
 * translators, and a data URL was being swept up by that same rule even though
 * the identical payload, handed to the translator as an inline block, converts
 * to a `file` / `input_audio` part.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS. Only `data:[<mediatype>][;…];base64,<non-empty payload>`. Three
 * near-misses are deliberately NOT read as inline data, and each one falls
 * through to the caller's pre-existing url handling rather than being guessed at:
 *
 *   1. NO `;base64` PARAMETER (`data:text/plain,hello`). RFC 2397's default
 *      encoding is percent-encoded text, not base64. The standard media block's
 *      `data` field is base64 BY DEFINITION — both translators feed it straight
 *      into `data:<mime>;base64,…` — so putting percent-encoded text there would
 *      hand the provider a payload that decodes to garbage. A wrong-but-quiet
 *      attachment is worse than the `image_url` this leaves it as.
 *   2. NO COMMA (`data:application/pdf;base64`) — not a data URL at all, there
 *      is no payload delimiter.
 *   3. AN EMPTY PAYLOAD (`data:application/pdf;base64,`). Same rule the inbound
 *      `image_url` branch already applies: a block whose `data` is the empty
 *      string is an attachment pointing at nothing.
 *
 * `startsWith("data:")` is CASE-SENSITIVE, matching the `image_url` branch of
 * {@link convertLangchainMultimodalToAgui} byte for byte. URI schemes are
 * case-insensitive per RFC 3986 §3.1, so `DATA:` is a legal spelling this
 * declines — but this file already declined it in the one place it looked for a
 * data URL, and one rule applied everywhere is worth more here than a second,
 * better rule applied in one place. The `;base64` parameter itself IS matched
 * case-insensitively, because RFC 2045 §6.1 makes the encoding token
 * case-insensitive and `;Base64` occurs in the wild.

 * The inline bytes an AG-UI media source carries, or `null` if it carries none.
 *
 * A `data` source obviously carries them. A `url` source carries them too WHEN
 * THE URL IS A `data:` URL — that is the whole point of this function, and the
 * defect it fixes: those bytes were being classified as a remote reference and
 * sent to the provider as `image_url`.
 *
 * A REMOTE url source returns `null` and is left exactly where it was. That
 * rule is not squeamishness, it is measured: a `source_type: "url"` standard
 * block throws in JS and raises in Python for audio, document and video alike,
 * so promoting one would turn a degraded request into a dead run. (NOT true of a
 * url-sourced `image` standard block, which both runtimes convert — but images
 * never take the standard-block path at all, they keep `image_url`
 * unconditionally, so that row is irrelevant here.)
 *
 * The MIME type INSIDE the data URL wins over one declared alongside it. RFC
 * 2397 §2 makes the mediatype a description of the payload that follows it in
 * the same string, where a `mimeType` on the source describes the reference; when
 * the two disagree the one attached to the bytes is the one the provider has to
 * be told. This is also what the `image_url` return leg already does — it
 * recovers the modality by reading the MIME type back out of the data URL and
 * ignores everything else. A data URL with an OMITTED mediatype (`data:;base64,…`)
 * has nothing to say, so the source's own `mimeType` is used.
 *
 * THE PAYLOAD ITSELF IS CHECKED, not just its presence. `value` is declared
 * `string` and is not validated at this boundary, so a `data` source can carry
 * `null`, a number or the empty string — and this is the value that goes on the
 * provider request as the media block's `data`. Emitting `data: null` sends the
 * model an attachment with no bytes in it, quietly, which is rule 1 of THE
 * MALFORMED-INPUT CONTRACT read the wrong way round: nothing raised, but nothing
 * was dropped or logged either, so the operator sees a request that merely fails
 * to mention the file. An unusable payload is an ABSENT payload — the same rule
 * this file already applies to a MIME type and to a filename — so it returns
 * `null` here, {@link mediaSourceToUrl} refuses it too, and the caller drops the
 * one item with the one warning it already emits for a source it cannot use.

 * A filename for a `file` block whose AG-UI item did not carry one.
 *
 * Not cosmetic. `@langchain/openai` THROWS on a file block with no filename
 * ("a filename or name or title is needed via meta-data for OpenAI when working
 * with multimodal blocks" — measured 2026-08-25 on `@langchain/openai@1.2.0`), so
 * the document path this converter claims to support has to carry one or it is
 * not actually supported.
 *
 * Python does not throw, and does not merely drop the key either: measured on
 * `langchain-core@1.2.13`, a nameless file block warns ("OpenAI may require a
 * filename for file uploads…") and the part goes out carrying the PLACEHOLDER
 * `filename: "LC_AUTOGENERATED"` — i.e. the provider is told the user attached a
 * file by that name. Substituting a derived name is an improvement on both.
 *
 * The two runtimes do NOT emit the same block: this one emits
 * `source_type` / `data` / `mime_type` / `metadata.filename`, the Python adapter
 * emits `base64` / `mime_type` / top-level `filename`. Both run the same
 * derivation — `_derive_filename` there is kept identical to this — so an
 * attachment gets the same name whichever runtime sent it.
 *
 * THE TWO BLOCKS ARE NOT INTERCHANGEABLE. An earlier revision of this paragraph
 * said they were — "both translate to the same provider part (verified through
 * both real translators)" — and only three of the four combinations hold.
 * Measured 2026-08-25 with an `application/pdf` file block, on
 * `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` + `@langchain/core@1.1.40` (through `ChatOpenAI` with
 * a stub `fetch`) and `langchain-core@1.2.13` (through
 * `convert_to_openai_messages`):
 *
 *   block emitted by   JS translator            Python translator
 *   -----------------  -----------------------  -----------------------
 *   this adapter       file.file_data ✓         file.file_data ✓
 *                      + file.filename          + file.filename
 *   the Python adapter FORWARDED VERBATIM ✗     file.file_data ✓
 *                      (reaches the provider    + file.filename
 *                      as `{"type": "file",
 *                      "base64": …, "mime_type":
 *                      …, "filename": …}`, with
 *                      no throw and no warning)
 *
 * The failing cell is the direction that does not occur. JS gates translation on
 * `isDataContentBlock`, which tests `source_type` and nothing else, and the
 * Python adapter never emits that key — the same trap {@link StandardMediaBlock}
 * documents for the JS-native shape. It stays LATENT because neither adapter's
 * output crosses into the other's translator, and for asymmetric reasons:
 *
 *   - This package drives a LangGraph SERVER over `@langchain/langgraph-sdk`,
 *     and that server is usually the Python one. Its blocks therefore have to
 *     translate in BOTH columns — which is exactly why row 1 is measured in both
 *     and why {@link StandardMediaBlock} picks the shape it picks.
 *   - The Python adapter's `LangGraphAgent` takes an IN-PROCESS
 *     `CompiledStateGraph`, not a remote deployment, so a block it emits is only
 *     ever handed to langchain-core Python — row 2's ✓ cell. Nothing in either
 *     package routes row 2 into the JS column.
 *
 * So the surviving claim is the narrower one: each block produces the same
 * provider part through the translator its own runtime actually reaches, and
 * this adapter's block additionally survives the other runtime's. Revisit if the
 * Python adapter ever grows a remote-server transport.
 *
 * THE SUBTYPE IS NOT THE EXTENSION. It coincides with one often enough to look
 * like a rule — `application/pdf`, `text/csv` — and then does not:
 * `text/plain` is not `.plain`, `audio/mpeg` is not `.mpeg`, and
 * `application/vnd.api+json` is not `.vnd.api`. So the subtype is a LAST resort
 * here, taken only when it survives being checked:
 *
 *   1. {@link FILENAME_EXTENSIONS} answers the types whose subtype is wrong.
 *   2. A structured-syntax suffix (RFC 6838 §4.2.8) names the underlying
 *      format, so `+json` / `+xml` wins over the vendor tree in front of it.
 *   3. Otherwise the registration-tree prefix (`vnd.`, `prs.`, `x-`, `x.`) is
 *      stripped, because it is a namespace and not part of any extension.
 *   4. What is left has to LOOK like an extension. `ms-excel` and
 *      `openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` do not, and a
 *      dot inside the "extension" turns `attachment.vnd.ms-excel` into a file
 *      apparently named `attachment.vnd`. Anything implausible becomes `.bin`,
 *      which is what an unidentified byte stream is called.
 *
 * MIME types are case-insensitive (RFC 2045 §5.1), so the lookup is case-folded.

 * Recover the AG-UI media type of an `image_url` block from the MIME type in its

 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `image_url` is not the image path — it is the fallback path
 * for every modality {@link standardBlockTypeFor} refuses, which is video (no
 * standard block converts, in either runtime), audio outside
 * {@link OPENAI_AUDIO_MIME_TYPES}, and every URL-sourced item. Reading the block
 * kind literally therefore turned an attached video into an `ImageInputContent`
 * in MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT, permanently: the thread was rewritten, and every later
 * read of it saw an image. The outbound leg is deliberately unchanged — see
 * {@link convertAguiMultimodalToLangchain} — so the fix belongs here.
 *
 * The MIME type inside `data:<mime>;base64,…` is the original one this adapter
 * put there, so on the DATA path the modality is fully recoverable. The mapping
 * mirrors how the legacy `binary` OUTBOUND leg classifies the same string:
 * image/video/audio by major type, everything else a document. Symmetric by
 * construction, which is the property that keeps a round trip stable.
 *
 * Two cases are NOT recoverable and stay images, which is what they already were:
 *
 *   1. URL-sourced media. `image_url` carries `{ url }` and nothing else, so a
 *      video at an https URL arrives with no MIME type and no other signal. AG-UI
 *      lets a url source declare `mimeType`, but this adapter cannot put it on
 *      the wire: extra keys inside a content block are what issue #2100 was about
 *      (strict OpenAI-compatible providers 400 on "Unexpected keys in a message
 *      content image dict"), and the outbound shape here is load-bearing. Guessing
 *      from a file extension is not a signal — signed and extensionless CDN URLs
 *      are the norm. So a URL-sourced non-image loses its modality, and this is
 *      the documented limit of this fix rather than something it covers.
 *   2. A data URL with no MIME type at all (`data:;base64,…`), where there is
 *      nothing to read. The pre-existing `image/png` default applies.
 *
 * `metadata.filename` is lost on this path in both directions regardless — the

/**
 * The media block this adapter emits: a LangChain `source_type` data block.

 * THIS IS THE ONLY REPRESENTATION THAT TRANSLATES IN BOTH RUNTIMES, and this

 * server which is usually the Python one. Measured 2026-08-25 against the locked
 * dependencies — `@langchain/core@1.1.40` + `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` through
 * `ChatOpenAI` with a stub `fetch`, and `langchain-core@1.2.13` through
 * `convert_to_openai_messages` — reading the request body each one produced:
 *
 *   shape                                    JS default path      Python
 *   ---------------------------------------  -------------------  ----------------
 *   source_type + data + mime_type           file.file_data ✓     file.file_data ✓
 *   Python native (base64/mime_type)         VERBATIM ✗           file.file_data ✓
 *   JS native (data/mimeType/metadata)       VERBATIM ✗           VERBATIM ✗
 *
 * "VERBATIM" is the trap. The block is neither translated nor rejected: it is
 * forwarded to the provider exactly as written, so the request carries a content
 * part the API does not accept. It is the failure mode in BOTH runtimes for a
 * shape that runtime does not recognise — the JS-native block came back out of
 * `convert_to_openai_messages` as `{"type": "file", "data": …, "mimeType": …,
 * "metadata": {…}}`, unchanged, with no exception and no warning. (An earlier
 * revision of this table claimed Python raised a `ValueError` on that row. It
 * does not, on 1.2.13 — silence is the actual behaviour, and it is worse.)
 *
 * On the JS side the cause is that the default conversion path gates translation
 * behind `isDataContentBlock`, which requires a `source_type` of `"url"` /
 * `"base64"` / `"text"` / `"id"`; a block without that key is not recognised as
 * media at all.
 *
 * `@langchain/core` does mark this family `@deprecated` ("Use
 * {@link ContentBlock.Multimodal.Data} instead" — the literal JSDoc in
 * `dist/messages/content/data.d.ts`), and the JS-native shape it points to
 * works — but ONLY on the v1 conversion path, which requires
 * `response_metadata.output_version === "v1"` on the message. This adapter does
 * not set that marker and cannot set it for a graph it does not own, so on the
 * path that actually runs, the non-deprecated shape is the one that silently
 * fails. The deprecated family costs nothing for staying: measured, it translates
 * to `file.file_data` on the v1 path too. Deprecated-and-translated beats
 * current-and-forwarded-raw.
 *
 * KNOWN LIMIT, measured and deliberately not addressed here: the Responses API.
 * Everything above is Chat Completions, which is where the reported failure was.
 * On `useResponsesApi: true` the same emitted block behaves differently, and no
 * single shape fixes both — the JS-native shape is correct on Responses/v1 and
 * forwarded raw on the Chat Completions default path, which is the bug this
 * change exists to fix. Measured 2026-08-25 on `@langchain/openai@1.2.0`, before
 * and after, reading the request body off a stub `fetch`:
 *
 *   case                          before                     after

 *
 * Note row 3's "before": on Chat Completions the old `image_url` block stayed an
 * `image_url` part. `input_image` is the RESPONSES spelling of the same mistake,
 * so only the Responses rows show it.
 *
 * Row 3 is two cases (default and v1), so the table covers six. Five of them go
 * from a wrong-kind part to a right-kind one. Row 1 goes the other way, and it is
 * the one to know about: the attachment stops being emitted at all, with no throw
 * and no warning, so the model answers without ever seeing it. The cause is
 * upstream and not reachable from here — `dist/converters/responses.js` handles
 * the v1 block kinds in one chain and audio's branch is empty
 * (`} else if (block.type === "audio") {}`), the only occurrence of "audio"
 * anywhere in that converter, sitting immediately before the `file`, `image` and
 * `video` branches, each of which resolves a real part.
 *
 * Note what row 1 is NOT: a working path that this change broke. Before, the
 * audio went out labelled as an image, so the request carried a part the API
 * does not accept for audio. The run failed then and produces a wrong answer now
 * — worse to diagnose, but not a lost capability.
 *
 * This converter cannot tell the two transports apart. It receives messages and
 * nothing else; the model is constructed inside the graph, on the far side of the
 * LangGraph server call. Emitting per-transport is not possible from here.
 *
 * Revisit when the JS default path translates native blocks without a marker, or
 * when the Responses v1 converter grows an audio branch. Neither has happened as
 * of `@langchain/openai@1.2.0` / `@langchain/core@1.1.40`, re-checked 2026-08-25:
 * a native block is still forwarded raw on the default path, and the audio branch
 * in `dist/converters/responses.js` is still empty.

 *      `Dropping `. A vanished attachment with no string to search for is the
 *      failure an operator cannot diagnose. This covers the drops that have no
 *      branch of their own: an item of an UNRECOGNISED TYPE is a drop too, and

 *   3. ONE BAD ITEM COSTS ONLY ITSELF. The items on either side of it in the
 *      same content array, and every other message in the list, still convert.
 *
 * All three are checkable from outside: for ANY input, each converter returns an
 * array, emits one warning per dropped item, and the surviving items are exactly
 * what the same input minus the bad item would have produced.

 * The Python adapter carries this same block above
