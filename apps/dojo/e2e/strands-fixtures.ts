/**
 * aimock fixtures for the AWS Strands interrupt, predictive-state and citations
 * demos.
 *
 * The interrupt and predictive-state flows make more than one model call per
 * user turn, and the responses differ by where in the flow the call happens
 * rather than by the user's text, so they need predicates rather than the
 * `userMessage` entries in fixtures/openai/*.json. The citations demo needs a
 * predicate for a different reason: its answers carry `citations`, and only
 * this demo's turns may.
 *
 * Every predicate is scoped to a phrase unique to the Strands demo's own system
 * prompt, so these never intercept another framework's demo (Mastra drives a
 * tool of the same name through the same dojo page, and the LangGraph
 * predictive-state demo drives a differently named one).
 *
 * Register via `registerStrandsFixtures(mockServer)` from aimock-setup.ts,
 * before the generic fixture-file loader.
