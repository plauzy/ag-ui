// Native interrupt for AWS Strands (Python). The demo's `schedule_meeting` is a
// backend tool that pauses ITSELF: it calls the tool context's `interrupt()`,
// which halts the Strands agent loop before the tool returns. The run finishes
// with `RUN_FINISHED.outcome = { type: "interrupt" }`, the dojo's shared
// interrupt page renders its time picker, and resuming hands the user's choice
// back to that same `interrupt()` call so the tool body carries on.
//
// The chosen time is asserted rather than just the picker disappearing: the card
// hides itself on click, so its absence is true whether or not anything resumed.
// The time the user clicked only exists in the tool's own result, so finding it
// there and in the agent's reply is what proves the round trip.
