 * not reach the wire: consumers validate every incoming event and throw on
 * failure, so one malformed count would fail an otherwise-successful run at its
 * final event — costing the user the answer, not just the token count.
 *
 * Dropping it is right; dropping it in silence is not. The usage this run
 * reports is then simply wrong, with nothing anywhere saying which count went
 * missing or why, so a present-but-unusable value is named once per key.
 *
 * `undefined` and `NaN` are exempt because they are not defects: they are how a
 * provider spells "did not report this count". `undefined` covers both shapes —
 * an absent key in LangChain's `usage_metadata`, an explicit `undefined` in
 * AI-SDK's `LanguageModelUsage` — and AI-SDK uses `NaN` for the same thing,
 * which is why its mapper's docstring says so. Warning on those would fire on
 * ordinary traffic and train the reader to ignore the message.
 *
 * `key` is the AG-UI count name the value was headed for, not the vendor's
 * spelling of it, so one message reads the same whichever mapper produced it.
