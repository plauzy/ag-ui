/**
 * The shared conformance fixture format.
 *
 * A fixture is one replayed stream plus the outcome the specification requires
 * of any client that consumes it. The same files drive the TypeScript lane
 * (this package) and the .NET lane, so the format is deliberately declarative:
 * it states what must be observable afterwards, never how a particular client
 * arrives there, because the two clients expose different surfaces.
 *
 * The files live at `spec/1.0/conformance/streams/*.json`; adding one is
 * documented in `spec/1.0/conformance/README.md`, one level up, because
 * `streams/` itself holds only the fixtures and the `MANIFEST.txt` listing
 * them.
