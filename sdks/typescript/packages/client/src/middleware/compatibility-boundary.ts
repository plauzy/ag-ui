/**
 * The always-on pre-1.0 compatibility boundary.
 *
 * With enforcement running AFTER middleware (PNI-205), anything nobody
 * translates is stripped with a warning. This middleware is the translator:
 * it upgrades every retired-but-understood inbound shape into its 1.0
 * equivalent, so no data an old peer sends is lost. It is deliberately NOT
 * version-gated — a legacy-shaped event arriving is itself the proof the
 * peer is old, and on a modern stream every branch below is a no-op.
 * Outgoing legacy binary attachments are also upgraded before the transport
 * validates or sends them. Their shape identifies the conversion regardless
 * of the peer ceiling; actual downgrades remain version-gated separately.
 *
 * Inbound conversions, each warned once per occurrence with a pointer to
 * the repo-root DEPRECATIONS.md:
 * - THINKING_* events -> their REASONING_* equivalents. The version-gated
 *   BackwardCompatibility_0_0_45 runs the same state machine and keeps its
 *   0.0.45 threshold, but it is not untouched: its synthesized
 *   REASONING_MESSAGE_START now says `role: "reasoning"` where it used to say
 *   "assistant", the same correction made here, because enforcement moved
 *   behind the middleware chain and made the invalid role fatal. In practice
 *   only this translation runs: THIS middleware is appended innermost, so it
 *   sees every thinking event first and the shim always finds nothing to do
 *   (see the corpus README's "A shim with no fixture").
 * - Legacy binary content parts inside inbound messages (MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT,
 *   RUN_STARTED input) -> the modern media parts.
 * - The three legacy nulls -> absent: parentMessageId on TOOL_CALL_START and
 *   TOOL_CALL_CHUNK, and RUN_FINISHED.outcome.
 * - Optional JSON payload nulls accepted before 1.0 -> absent: rawEvent,
 *   run/subagent result, media-part metadata, and optional JSON request fields
 *   inside RUN_STARTED.input. Required and nested data nulls survive.
