 * Both halves of that placement need a qualifier. Chunk expansion also happens
 * INSIDE the chain, in `Middleware.runNext`, and that expansion is upstream of
 * this stage rather than downstream — which is why chunks/transform.ts must
 * carry through whatever it cannot vouch for instead of repairing or dropping
 * it. And "after the middleware chain" says nothing on `connect`, where there
 * is no chain to be after: this stage still runs, on events arriving straight
 * off the transport.
 *
 * - An event whose type nothing translated is dropped, with a warning.
 * - Unknown properties and unrecognised union members on a known event are
 *   stripped, each with a warning naming its path.
 * - A malformed value on a field the protocol DOES describe stays fatal:
 *   the generated validator throws, and the run errors.
