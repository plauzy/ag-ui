# ag-ui-spring · spring-ai


Spring AI integration for the [AG-UI protocol](https://docs.ag-ui.com).

It adapts a Spring AI
[`ChatClient`](https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/chatclient.html) into
an AG-UI
`Agent`,
so any Spring AI model (OpenAI, Ollama, …) can drive an AG-UI front end. The
`ChatClient` is the high-level entry point (advisors, memory, default prompts,
registered tools) and is built over any `ChatModel`.

## What's inside

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`SpringAiAgent`](src/main/java/com/agui/community/spring/ai/SpringAiAgent.java) | Wraps a `ChatClient`. Maps the `RunAgentInput` conversation onto a Spring AI prompt, streams the response (`Flux<ChatResponse>`), and emits the AG-UI event lifecycle. |

## Event mapping

A run produces the following AG-UI events:

```
RUN_STARTED
  REASONING_START                     (for <think>...</think> content)
    REASONING_MESSAGE_START
      REASONING_MESSAGE_CONTENT*
    REASONING_MESSAGE_END
  REASONING_END
  TEXT_MESSAGE_START                  (when the model produces text)
    TEXT_MESSAGE_CONTENT*
  TEXT_MESSAGE_END
  TOOL_CALL_START                     (per tool call the model requests)
    TOOL_CALL_ARGS*
  TOOL_CALL_END
RUN_FINISHED
```

**Reasoning** is detected from inline `<think>...</think>` tags in the streamed
text (the provider-agnostic convention reasoning models use, and the reason
Spring AI ships a `ThinkingTagCleaner`). Content inside the tags is emitted as
the reasoning sub-stream; content outside is emitted as text. Tags split across
streaming chunks are reassembled. Models that don't use think tags are
unaffected — all content is emitted as text.

Reasoning that comes back in the run's conversation history — an AG-UI
`ReasoningMessage` (role `reasoning`, added in ag-ui `0.1.1`) — is replayed to
the model as an assistant message wrapped in the same `<think>...</think>` tags,
so a reasoning turn round-trips symmetrically. A blank reasoning message (for
example one that carried only a provider-specific `encryptedValue`) is dropped.

The agent owns the **tool-execution loop**, distinguishing two kinds of tools:

- **Client-side tools** — those on the `RunAgentInput`. Advertised to the model
  and surfaced as `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END` events for the front end to execute;
  the agent does not run them.
- **Backend tools** — registered with `SpringAiAgent.builder(client).tools(...)`,
  **or directly on the `ChatClient`** via `ChatClient.builder(model).defaultTools(...)`.
  When the model calls one, the agent emits `TOOL_CALL_START/ARGS/END`, **executes
  it** (via Spring AI's `ToolCallingManager`), emits a **`TOOL_CALL_RESULT`**, then
  re-prompts the model with the result — looping until the model stops calling
  backend tools. If a turn mixes backend and client calls, the backend results are
  emitted and the run stops so the front end handles the client calls. While the
  agent drives this loop (whenever any client tool, backend tool, the state tool, or
  an interrupt tool is advertised) it suppresses the `ChatClient`'s own automatic
  tool execution, so it executes the `ChatClient`'s `defaultTools(...)` callbacks
  itself rather than leaking them to the front end.

**Tool-call mapping**: streaming argument chunks are correlated by tool-call id;
the first chunk carrying an id (or a name) opens the call, later chunks append
argument deltas. Providers that omit the id (e.g. Ollama) get a synthesized one.
Any open text message is closed before a tool call starts.

**Conversation history**: on the next turn the front end sends back the prior
assistant message (with its tool calls) and the `tool` result messages. The agent
reconstructs these as Spring AI `AssistantMessage` (carrying the `ToolCall`s) and
`ToolResponseMessage` — so the model sees that a client tool it requested has
already run and responds, instead of re-issuing the same call every turn.

**Generative UI**: each `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` is emitted as its **own** conversation
message — a fresh `messageId` (distinct from the assistant turn that made the call)
with `role: tool`. Front ends such as CopilotKit key messages by id, so reusing the
assistant message id would overwrite the assistant tool call — and any generative UI
rendered from it — with the result. Keeping the result a separate message lets the
rendered component persist alongside the follow-up text.

**State** (opt-in) syncs AG-UI [shared state](https://docs.ag-ui.com/concepts/state).
When enabled the agent:

- emits an initial `STATE_SNAPSHOT` echoing `RunAgentInput.state` at run start;
- injects the current state into the prompt and advertises an `update_state`
  tool (taking the complete new state);
- intercepts the model's call to that tool and emits the new state — the call is
  **not** surfaced as a `TOOL_CALL_*` event, and it is not executed server-side.

State changes are emitted as a full `STATE_SNAPSHOT` by default, or as a
`STATE_DELTA` (RFC 6902 JSON Patch, diffed against the run's input state) when
configured with `StateUpdates.DELTA`. The model always supplies the complete new
state; the agent computes the delta, so it stays reliable regardless of the
model's ability to produce JSON Patch.

If the model errors, a terminal `RUN_ERROR` event is emitted instead of
propagating the failure — matching the protocol's in-band error handling.

## Usage

Build a `ChatClient` over any `ChatModel` — add advisors, chat memory, default
prompts and registered tools as needed:

```java
ChatClient chatClient = ChatClient.builder(chatModel)
        .defaultSystem("You are a helpful assistant.")
        .defaultTools(myTools)
        .build();
Agent agent = new SpringAiAgent(chatClient);
```

For a quick start, `ChatClient.create(chatModel)` builds a client with defaults.

To enable AG-UI shared state, use the builder:

```java
Agent agent = SpringAiAgent.builder(chatClient)
        .shareState(true)
        .stateUpdates(SpringAiAgent.StateUpdates.DELTA)   // optional; default is SNAPSHOT
        .build();
```

Combine with `ag-ui-spring-webflux-server` (reactive) or
`ag-ui-spring-webmvc-server` (servlet) to expose it over HTTP. The
[`ag-ui-spring-ai-spring-boot-starter`](../spring-ai-spring-boot-starter) (WebFlux)
and [`ag-ui-spring-ai-webmvc-boot-starter`](../spring-ai-webmvc-boot-starter)
(Servlet) do this automatically from the auto-configured `ChatClient.Builder`; to
customise the client, define the `Agent` bean yourself (which overrides the
auto-configured one):

```java
@Bean
Agent agent(ChatClient.Builder builder) {
    return new SpringAiAgent(builder.defaultSystem("…").build());
}
```

## Scope

Advertises the **input tools** to the model and maps streamed **text**,
**reasoning** (`<think>` tags), **tool calls** and — when state sharing is
enabled — **shared state** (`STATE_SNAPSHOT` or `STATE_DELTA`) to AG-UI events.

`MESSAGES_SNAPSHOT` is opt-in via `SpringAiAgent.builder(client).emitMessagesSnapshot(true)`:
when enabled the agent emits, just before `RUN_FINISHED`, a snapshot of the run's
durable conversation — the run input's messages plus the assistant messages (text
and tool calls) and backend `tool` result messages produced this run. It is additive
(the same messages are already conveyed by the streamed events), so a front end that
reconstructs history from the stream is unaffected; streamed reasoning is not included
in the snapshot. `TOOL_CALL_RESULT` is emitted for **backend** tools (which the agent
executes); **client** tool results are produced by the front end that runs the tool.
