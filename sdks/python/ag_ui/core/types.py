"""
This module contains the types for the Agent User Interaction Protocol.

Since PNI-213 it is a compatibility surface: every protocol shape is
re-exported from the generated models (``ag_ui._generated.models``, emitted
from ``spec/1.0/schema.json`` — regenerate with
``pnpm --filter @ag-ui/spec generate``). Only the package's own non-protocol
pieces (the reserved metadata key, historic aliases) are declared here.

The legacy ``BinaryInputContent`` part left the protocol in 1.0 (see
DEPRECATIONS.md): producers send the media parts (image, audio, video,
document) with a ``source``. Two TypeScript shims cover it, and both move in
the SAME direction — legacy to modern. The always-on inbound compatibility
boundary (``CompatibilityBoundary``) upgrades a legacy part arriving inside a
message, and the version-gated ``BackwardCompatibility_0_0_47`` middleware
upgrades one on the way out, rewriting ``RunAgentInput.messages`` through
``convertBinaryToNewFormat`` before the request is sent. Nothing converts a
modern media part back to ``{"type": "binary"}``. The version gate is about
the CALLER rather than the payload: an application still assembling messages
the pre-0.0.48 way is the only place a legacy part can still enter, so the
upgrade is installed for exactly those peers and skipped for everyone else.

Reservation is by convention: nothing rejects a write to this key at runtime,
