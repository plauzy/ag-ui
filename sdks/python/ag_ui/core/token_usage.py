"""
Vendor -> :class:`TokenUsage` mappers and aggregation for the Python SDK.

Python twin of ``sdks/typescript/packages/core/src/token-usage.ts``. Producers
(the LangGraph integration today) accumulate one entry per model call and
aggregate at the terminal event, so ``RUN_FINISHED.usage`` / ``RUN_ERROR.usage``
carry one summary per ``(provider, model)``.

Only numeric counts and the optional provider/model labels are ever mapped.
:class:`TokenUsage` feeds anonymous usage telemetry, so no prompt, completion,
message or other content-bearing field may be copied into it — see the type's
own docstring.

    Accept a value only if it is a real, finite, non-negative whole number that
    fits the wire, and return it as an ``int``.

    Providers do hand over strings, ``None``s and ``NaN``s in their usage
    metadata, and a bad value must not reach the wire: consumers validate every
    incoming event and raise on failure, so one malformed count would fail an
    otherwise-successful run at its final event — costing the user the answer,
    not just the token count.

    This guards harder than the TypeScript ``num()`` it mirrors, which only
    checks finiteness and leaves the integer/non-negative bound to schema
    validation. In Python that bound is enforced by :class:`TokenUsage` itself
    (``Optional[int]`` with ``ge=0``), i.e. by a constructor the *producer*
    calls — so an unguarded ``-1`` or ``1.5`` would not merely reach the wire,
    it would raise inside the producer's own terminal-event path and kill the
    run there. Rejecting the count is strictly better than losing the run.

    ``bool`` is excluded even though it subclasses ``int``: ``True`` is not a
    token count, and TypeScript's ``typeof v === "number"`` would not have
    admitted it either.
