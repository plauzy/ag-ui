# Cross-language fixtures

Fixtures in this directory are shared by more than one AG-UI SDK. They exist so a wire-format
expectation is written down **once** and every SDK is held to the same text, instead of each SDK
carrying its own copy that can drift.

A fixture here is plain JSON with no language-specific assumptions. Per-SDK fixtures that only ever
serve one implementation stay inside that SDK's test tree.

## `null-omission.json`

The contract that a producer leaves a field **out** of the JSON when it has no value, rather than
writing it as `null`.

TypeScript gets this for free (`JSON.stringify` drops `undefined`). Python and .NET do not — their
serializers write `null` by default — and the divergence cost the protocol three receiving-side
tolerance patches before it was fixed at the source (`TOOL_CALL_START.parentMessageId`,
`TOOL_CALL_CHUNK.parentMessageId`, `RUN_FINISHED.outcome` all still accept `null` for the benefit of
older producers). The fixture pins the behaviour so a fourth one is not needed.

### Shape

```jsonc
{
  "stream": [
    {
      "name": "run_finished_without_result_or_outcome",
      "producedBy": ["typescript", "python", "dotnet"],
      "note": "why this case is here",
      "input": {
        "type": "RUN_FINISHED",
        "threadId": "thread_1",
        "runId": "run_1",
      },
      "expected": {
        "type": "RUN_FINISHED",
        "threadId": "thread_1",
        "runId": "run_1",
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Each SDK's test walks `stream` and, for every case listing its own name in `producedBy`:

1. deserializes `input` into the SDK's native event type,
2. re-serializes it through the SDK's official producer path (its event encoder / SSE formatter),
3. asserts the emitted JSON parses to exactly `expected`.

Because `expected` is exact, a stray `null` fails the case, and a `null` that the contract _does_
carry (an individual metadata value, a value inside a state snapshot or a JSON Patch operation) must
still be there. Cases are meant to be read as one plausible stream of events, top to bottom.

`producedBy` exists only for event types an SDK genuinely does not implement. It is not an escape
hatch for a case an SDK fails. Every case here currently lists all three SDKs — the chunk events
were the last exemption, and .NET has implemented them since; if you find yourself reaching for a
shorter list, say in `note` exactly what the missing SDK lacks, so the entry can be deleted when it
gains it.

### Consumers

| SDK        | Test                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TypeScript | `sdks/typescript/packages/encoder/src/__tests__/null-omission.test.ts`     |
| Python     | `sdks/python/tests/test_null_omission.py`                                  |
| .NET       | `sdks/dotnet/tests/AGUI.Abstractions.UnitTests/NullOmissionFixtureTest.cs` |

Those fixture tests check that the SDKs agree with each other. Each SDK additionally has a
reflection-driven test that walks _every_ wire type it defines — not just the ones named here — and
fails on any `null` the contract does not permit. Adding a case here does not remove the need for
that broader sweep; the two catch different things.

### Wiring a new consumer: make the build see this directory

A fixture here sits outside every SDK's project directory, so a build system that decides what to
re-run by looking only inside a project will not notice it changing. Each consumer needs that dealt
with explicitly, or an edit here can leave a stale green result behind:

- **.NET** links the file in as an `EmbeddedResource` (see
  `AGUI.Abstractions.UnitTests.csproj`). MSBuild tracks `EmbeddedResource` items, so this is
  handled.
- **Python** is run directly by `unittest`, with no caching layer. Nothing to do.
- **TypeScript** runs under Nx, which caches `test` on `{projectRoot}/**/*` — this directory is not
  in it. `@ag-ui/encoder` therefore sets `nx.targets.test.cache: false` in its `package.json`; its
  suite takes well under a second, so always running it is cheaper than the risk.

A second thing a new consumer needs: **a CI trigger**. This directory sits outside every path list
in `.github/workflows/unit-*.yml`, so until `sdks/fixtures/**` was added to each of them a PR
editing only a fixture here ran no SDK **test** job. Not no job at all: `typecheck-typescript.yml`
matched it through its blanket `sdks/**` entry and compiled the workspace, which cannot fail on a
fixture's contents. Nothing that executes these documents ran. All three unit workflows now list
`sdks/fixtures/**`, in both their `push` and `pull_request` filters; a new consumer in a fourth
workflow needs the same line.

The obvious alternative — adding `{workspaceRoot}/sdks/fixtures/**/*` to the `test` target's
`inputs` in `nx.json` — **does not work**, and was tried. On Nx 22.5.0 in this workspace a
`{workspaceRoot}` input does not reach the hasher: verified with a tracked control file at the
repository root, which changed the file without changing the task hash. Don't spend time on it
again; turn caching off for the consuming project instead.

### Whole-field null and nested null

A whole optional field set to `null` means absence, including optional arbitrary-JSON payloads.
Producers omit the field; the schema requires omission instead of an explicit `null`. This rule
applies to `rawEvent`, run and subagent `result`, tool `parameters`, resume `payload`, run input
`state` and `forwardedProps`, and media-part `metadata`. It is the same rule in every SDK.

Required arbitrary-JSON fields retain a whole `null` value: `STATE_SNAPSHOT.snapshot`, `RAW.event`,
`CUSTOM.value`, and the `value` of a JSON Patch add, replace or test operation. The nullable .NET
type of `CUSTOM.value` does not change that requirement; its serializer explicitly preserves null.
`ACTIVITY_SNAPSHOT.content` is a required object, so a whole `null` is invalid in every SDK.

Nulls nested inside any permitted object or array remain data and survive unchanged. For example,
an optional `result: null` is omitted, while `result: {"selectedId": null}` is retained. The same
distinction applies to nulls under metadata keys and inside state objects or arrays.

## `agent-capabilities.json`

`AgentCapabilities` is defined once, in `spec/1.0/schema.json`, and generated for every SDK. Until
1.0 each SDK carried its own hand-written copy, and they had drifted: .NET typed
`identity.metadata` and `custom` as dictionaries where the others carried open JSON, and all three
spelled the subagent list `subAgents` while the rest of the protocol spells the word as one
(`subagentRunId`). The fixture pins the generated model's wire
shape so the three cannot drift apart again.

### Shape

```jsonc
{
  "cases": [
    {
      "name": "partial_as_a_real_producer_declares",
      "producedBy": ["typescript", "python", "dotnet"],
      "note": "why this case is here",
      "input": {
        "identity": { "type": "langgraph" },
        "transport": { "streaming": true },
      },
      "expected": {
        "identity": { "type": "langgraph" },
        "transport": { "streaming": true },
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

Each SDK's test walks `cases` and, for every case listing its own name in `producedBy`:

1. parses `input` into the SDK's `AgentCapabilities` model,
2. serializes it back through the SDK's official JSON path,
3. asserts the result parses to exactly `expected`.

`expected` is exact, so an unset optional member appearing as `null` fails the case, and so does any
SDK inventing a value for a group the input left out — omitted means _undeclared_, and no SDK may
fill it in. A `null` _value_ under an open-by-key member (`identity.metadata`, `custom`) is the
opposite case: it is data, the protocol says it MUST be preserved, and the `open_values_may_be_null`
case holds every SDK to carrying it through unchanged. The `full_every_group_populated` case exercises every field, including the two .NET
gained and the one-word `subagents` key. All four documents — `full_every_group_populated`,
`minimal_nothing_declared`, `partial_as_a_real_producer_declares` and `open_values_may_be_null` —
sit under `spec/1.0/fixtures/AgentCapabilities/valid/` as `full.json`, `minimal.json`,
`partial.json` and `open-values-null.json`, where the spec harness validates them against the
schema; this file is where the SDKs are held to each other. The mapping is not a convention anyone
has to remember: `spec/harness/fixtures.test.ts` asserts it in both directions, and that the two
copies of each document parse to the same value (`expect(c.input).toEqual(spec)` on the parsed
JSON — so formatting and key order may differ between the copies, but no value may).
