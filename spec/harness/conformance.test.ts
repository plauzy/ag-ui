/**
 * The gate over the conformance fixture corpus.
 *
 * The fixtures themselves are run by each client's own lane — TypeScript in
 * `@ag-ui/client`, .NET in `AGUI.Client.UnitTests` — because only a client can
 * say what a client does. What belongs here is everything true of the corpus
 * regardless of who consumes it: that each file is well formed, that a
 * divergence between the two clients is always explained, and that the
 * behaviours this suite exists to pin all still have a fixture.
 *
 * Both lanes discover fixtures by reading this directory, so "every fixture
 * runs in both lanes" is structural rather than asserted: a file added here is
 * picked up by both, and a lane that stopped reading the directory would fail
 * its own has-fixtures check.
