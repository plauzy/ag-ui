/**
 * The published address is part of the contract, not a deployment detail.
 *
 * Every schema file names its own web address in `$id`, and a tool that meets
 * one fetches that address to resolve it. The address therefore has to serve
 * the file, and the shape chosen for the draft is the shape every frozen
 * version inherits — those are permanent, so a mistake here is expensive.
 *
 * What this file can check is what this repository controls: that the file is
 * published, that it is the schema rather than a stale copy of it, that its
 * `$id` agrees with the address it is served at, and that no documentation
 * page is named so that it would shadow it. The routing and the CORS header
 * live in Cloudflare, which no test here can see; docs/spec/README.md records
 * that configuration, who owns it, and how to verify it by hand.
