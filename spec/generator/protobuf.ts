/**
 * The protobuf emitter: model in, .proto files, the wire freeze, and the
 * TypeScript translation layer out.
 *
 * Two truths meet here. The schema owns what exists; the freeze file owns
 * what it is numbered on the wire. A frozen slot keeps its number forever —
 * schema order is irrelevant to the wire — and a genuinely new slot gets the
 * next free number in its message, appended to the freeze by the generator
 * itself. A freeze entry whose schema field is gone becomes a protobuf
 * `reserved` statement, so numbers are never reused. Nobody authors a number.
 *
 * The tables in this file are transport shape, not field meaning: which
 * strategy renders a union on the wire, what a message is called in proto,
 * where a merged field lands. Descriptions still come from the schema; if a
 * field's meaning ever appears here, it has escaped the schema.
